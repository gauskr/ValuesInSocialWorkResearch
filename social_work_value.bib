Abstract = {The current debate on social work research methods shares some of the
   features of a general `crisis in epistemology' evident in many academic
   disciplines which in turn is related to unresolved issues concerning
   scientific knowledge production in modernity. Social work's own attempts
   to develop a research basis, as its entry into modernity, shows
   historically a polarisation between a leaning towards positivist models
   as well as an affirmation of the importance of reflecting on personhood
   and the self in line with hermeneutic principles. It is hypothesised
   that political interests emanating from neoliberal social policies
   favour currently a positivist meaning of `evidence' in practice research
   with implications of `value neutrality' while social work practice needs
   to always address persons and their structural context equally.
   Therefore the polarisation between positivist and hermeneutic research
   orientations must be maintained as an impulse to acknowledge specific
   human qualities. Beyond implications for researcher-practitioners this
   perspective also contributes to a better understanding of future
   directions of epistemology in other disciplines.},

Abstract = {This paper, drawing on a study of social work research in UK
   universities, asksand suggests provisional answers totwo questions.
   First, is it possible to identify ways to categorize the kinds of
   research in social work in a form that recognizes and respects the aims
   and values of social work? Second, assuming we ought to do so, in what
   ways should the quality of social work research be assessed? In response
   to examination of output from the 2001 RAE, a national workshop and
   several focus groups, we developed a classification of kinds of research
   according to two different dimensions: On whom is the primary
   substantive focus of the research? What is the primary problem focus of
   the research? In terms of assessing quality, we believe that the social
   work community should not be aiming for precise standards. We recommend
   a fitness for purpose, which should include guidance on how different
   stakeholder communities should apply quality judgments. However, while
   all stakeholders should sign up to the broad dimensions and standards,
   their application should always leave scope for flexibility and local
   relevance. Quality should be based on justification of both inner and
   outer science considerations.},

Abstract = {Research has been a contested dimension of Chilean social work. An
   important turn occurred in 2008 when Chilean national research
   policies-highly influenced by managerialist approaches-increased
   opportunities for social workers to conduct research. Several efforts
   have been made by academics and professional social work organisations
   to encourage research as a means of gaining recognition as a discipline.
   Drawing upon a thematic literature review from a Chilean-based study on
   social workers' research trajectories, this article contends that,
   despite the value of such efforts, there are some tensions related to
   the acritical adoption of such a managerialist approach on social work
   research that need further attention: (i) research does not have the
   same value for all social work sectors; (ii) social work research is
   mainly understood as `academic' research; and (iii) social workers'
   research does not necessarily have a `social work focus'. These findings
   are discussed in light of the historical background of Chilean social
   work and the insights provided by the international literature, from
   which we conclude that the creation of more inclusive and collaborative
   ways of conducting research is an urgent challenge. Findings are
   context-specific, yet, offer considerations for social work research
   seeking to counteract managerial approaches of knowledge production.},

Abstract = {Debates around the issues of knowledge of, and for, social work and
   other social justice-oriented professions are not uncommon. More
   prevalent are the discussions around the ways by which social work
   knowledge is obtained. In recent years, social work scholars have drawn
   on the epistemology of pragmatism to present a case for its value in the
   creation of knowledge for social work and other social justice-oriented
   professions. The primary focus of this essay is on providing a critical
   review and synthesis of the literature regarding pragmatism as a
   research paradigm. In this essay, we analyze the major philosophical
   underpinnings and methodological challenges associated with pragmatism,
   synthesize the works of scholars who have contributed to the
   understanding of pragmatism as a research paradigm, articulate our
   thoughts about how pragmatism fits within social work research, and
   illustrate how it is linked to the pursuit of social justice. This
   article brings together a variety of perspectives to argue that
   pragmatism has the potential to closely engage and empower marginalized
   and oppressed communities and provide hard evidence for the macro level
   discourse.},

Abstract = {Just as its parent profession has grappled with identity problems,
   social work research has struggled to assert its legitimacy. A
   convincing case has not yet been made to enable it to claim
   authoritative status in its own right. Alternative trends can be
   identified as social work research has sought a niche. On one hand, it
   has been defined in pragmatic terms according to formal occupational
   efinitions and the conventional terrain of social work practice. Here
   the focus has been on developing evidence about practice, but perhaps
   not so much `with' or `for' practice. On the other hand, strong
   arguments have been made for a `committed' paradigm, drawing validation
   from its identification with minority and service user interests. It is
   possible to make a case for social work research as a discrete and
   authoritative project, on the basis of its essential values, but how far
   does this get us in asserting its academic merits and quality, such as
   when submitting knowledge claims to critical scrutiny. This study
   suggests that social work research can indeed claim to be distinctive
   and authoritative. It may not hold its key characteristics uniquely, but
   in combination they offer a distinctive sense of identity and purpose.},

Abstract = {Despite the congruence between critical feminist values and the cardinal
   values of the social work profession, feminist research in social work
   has lagged behind its feminist cousins in the social sciences,
   particularly in terms of critical uses of theory, reflexivity, and the
   troubling of binaries. This article presents as praxis our reflections
   as researchers, teachers, and feminists inside social work. We draw from
   a review of feminist social work research and offer suggestions for
   teaching critical feminist approaches in social work research.
   Incorporating critical feminist values and research practices into
   social work research courses creates the potential for greater
   integration of research, practice, and the principal values of our
   profession.},

Abstract = {.Summary: The authors present the field of social work with a
   methodology specifically aimed at the synthesis of qualitative research
   informed by existing methods and applications yet tailored to the unique
   values and goals of the profession of social work.
   Findings: Though qualitative research in social work is commonplace,
   currently, the field lacks a methodology to synthesize these qualitative
   studies. A synthesis of qualitative studies results in generation of a
   more in-depth understanding of the phenomena studied that can be used to
   develop theory and inform practice and policy.
   Applications: This methodology enables synergistic understanding of
   phenomena with richness in diversity of settings, participants, and
   qualitative traditions. This synergistic understanding can be used to
   develop theory and inform practice and policy.},

Abstract = {Missing data are nearly always a problem in research, and missing values
   represent a serious threat to the validity of inferences drawn from
   findings. Increasingly, social science researchers are turning to
   multiple imputation to handle missing data. Multiple imputation, in
   which missing values are replaced by values repeatedly drawn from
   conditional probability distributions, is an appropriate method for
   handling missing data when values are not missing completely at random.
   However, use of this method requires developing an imputation model from
   the observed data. This is typically a rigorous and time-consuming
   process. To encourage wider adoption of multiple imputation in social
   work research, a simple framework for designing imputation models is
   presented. The framework and its ability to generate unbiased estimates
   are demonstrated in a simulation study.},

   research, one possible methodology based on Foucault's archaeological
   approach to discourse is mapped out.
   Findings: While welcoming the turn toward and engagement with discourse,
   this article argues that limitations in the analytical involvement and
   detailed methodological treatment with the technical aspects of
   Foucauldian discourse analysis compromise the value of this social work
   research. A possible methodology, based on Foucault's archaeological
   approach to discourse, is developed to demonstrate the possibilities
   discourse analysis can bring to social work research. This is contrasted
   with various misappropriations of Foucault's conception of discourse
   within a range of methodological, political and epistemological contexts
   that have influenced the construction of critical social work.
   Application: Alongside demonstrating the specific merits of
   archaeological discourse analysis as a tool to enable the scrutiny and
   investigation of received social work values, practices and policies in
   terms of their social function, this article highlights the necessity of
   engaging with the technical aspects of complex social theory in order to
   maintain robust methodological foundations.},

Abstract = {This study evaluates the value of digital video data in qualitative
   social work research at each stage of the research process. Through an
   analytic narrative review of the social work literature and related
   social sciences fields, the article argues that video data are
   under-utilized in social work research despite great opportunity to
   enhance the research process and articulate with social work values in
   the research encounter. The unique contributions of video data in the
   collection, analysis, and dissemination stages of research are
   considered, along with a brief discussion of the interactive nature of
   these stages in participatory action research designs that train
   participants in media production. The added benefits that video affords
   research participants as well as the unique challenges and limitations
   of video-based research design are reviewed and evaluated in relation to
   the social work profession. Social workers are called upon to embrace
   video data in qualitative research to produce critical counter
   narratives that combat harmful misrepresentations of disenfranchised
   populations and thereby advance the profession's mission and values.},

Abstract = {This article presents feminist standpoint theory as an epistemology to
   move social work research and practice toward a synthesis of relevance
   and rigor. Feminist standpoint theory provides an alternative approach
   to knowledge justification and `'good science.'' The article discusses
   three assumptions of positivist approaches to science and research and
   highlights some of the conflicts between those assumptions and the
   professional commitments of social work. The specific areas of conflict
   identified include claims of value-free scientific activity,
   subject-object separation, and scientific objectivity. Feminist
   standpoint theory is an approach to research that is more consonant with
   the professional values and goals of social work. The theory places the
   life experiences of marginalized groups at the center of the research
   project. It then directs the view of the researcher toward the social
   structures that shape the lives of the group members. The advantages of
   standpoint theory for social work practice and research are highlighted.},

Abstract = {In the context of discussions about the potential of collaborative
   research, a practice-based project was implemented in Auckland, New
   Zealand during 2006 and 2007, aimed to help develop a culture of enquiry
   among practitioners in social service. One design variable in this
   project was the World Cafe, a conversational process that helps groups
   to engage in constructive dialogue around critical questions, to build
   personal relationships, and to foster collaborative learning. In
   relation to other collaborative approaches, the World Cafe is powerful
   in terms of the use of cross-pollination of ideas through evolving
   rounds of information exchange and the use of a cafe -style social
   context that allows the sharing of information in an equitable and
   non-threatening manner. This article reports on the design and
   implementation of a World Cafe approach, located in the philosophy of
   appreciative inquiry, through `Cafe Hear and Now'. The authors reflect
   on the perceived value of this initiative and invite dialogue on the
   implementation of the World Cafe in social work research.},

Abstract = {A response to the critique of where social work research currently
   stands, as put forth by Garrow and Hasenfeld, and their position that
   social work research should be undertaken from a feminist perspective.
   It is important to remember the origins and foundation of feminist
   thought and to approach research and practice with a full understanding
   of what both empiricist epistemology and feminist standpoint
   epistemology actually means. Maintaining a balanced perspective and
   recognizing the value in varied approaches to scientific inquiry will
   keep the field of social work moving toward its ultimate goal of
   reducing the plight of marginalized and oppressed peoples. Social work
   research and practice has always claimed itself to be committed to
   furthering social justice and equality and to building a society with a
   minimum of human suffering. In order to remain focused on these goals,
   perhaps a shift in perspective is necessary.},

Abstract = {Service user involvement in research has triggered debate about
   epistemology, power relationships between researchers and participants,
   ethics and the validity of research findings. The social work profession
   encourages respect for service users and promotion of their
   rights-values which arguably should be reflected in social work
   research. This paper presents a case study of service user involvement
   in a government-funded adoption research project. The research team
   included a birth relative consultant group and the paper discusses both
   the process and outcomes of their involvement. The benefits and costs of
   service user involvement are highlighted. Reflections from the
   consultants about their experiences of being involved in the research
   are included. The discussion positions the project in relation to
   existing theories and models of service user involvement.},

Abstract = {The paper examines the processes of a research project about the
   continuing care needs of head-injured people in order to illustrate an
   interactive approach in social work research. Influenced by the social
   work values of empowerment and working in partnership, the key functions
   of the interactive approach include a multidisciplinary research team
   analysing the research topic through different disciplinary
   perspectives, and selecting research methods and dissemination
   strategies that promote interactive relationships amongst researchers,
   respondents and sponsors. Social work practice supplies transferable
   knowledge, values and skills for the interactive approach. The skill of
   negotiation is used to mitigate unequal distributions of power between
   researchers and respondents. The paper concludes that the interactive
   approach is a distinctive characteristic of social work research that
   deserves wider recognition.},

Abstract = {Qualitative research continues to excite interest in social work inquiry
   spurring, in the process, a corresponding interest in social justice
   research. Yet, much remains to be done concerning the development of
   innovative frameworks for doing social justice social work research.
   Lack of effective research tools stymies social workers' efforts at
   responding appropriately to the needs of culturally diverse service
   users and the structures that oppress them. This article introduces an
   integrated framework of critical cultural competence and anti-oppressive
   practice for doing qualitative social work research. Juxtaposing the
   cultural sensitivity powers of critical cultural competence with the
   social justice values of anti-oppressive practice enhances understanding
   of the salience of culture in human behavior, while promoting deeper
   appreciation of difference and the effects of oppression as experienced
   through social identities.},

Abstract = {The evidence base for the methodological validity of conducting
   participatory research is becoming established. This article reviews the
   experiences of two researchers undertaking Ph.D. studies in Slovenia and
   UK, respectively, and considers the value of involving service users and
   carers in social work research. The Slovenian research involved
   user-researchers who developed research tools and undertook qualitative
   research. The first author explores the co-researchers' impact on the
   research process and its outcomes, identifying both individual and
   collective empowerment of the co-researchers. The English study involved
   people from diverse backgrounds, who developed a recovery training
   programme for carers of people with schizophrenia. The second author
   describes how the steering group, and the carers who participated in the
   programme were impacted by the research process and experienced a sense
   of empowerment and how they influenced the development of new knowledge
   through the reflexive cycle. The authors draw out the commonalities and
   differences in our research that add to the existing evidence base
   supporting the development of participatory inquiry. We conclude by
   affirming the value of user participation in research in leading to the
   empowerment of users, the development of new research perspectives, and

Abstract = {Social scientists frequently study complex constructs. Despite the
   plethora of measures for these constructs, researchers may need to
   create their own measure for a particular study. When a measure is
   created, psychometric testing is required, and the first step is to
   study the content validity of the measure. The purpose of this article
   is to demonstrate how to conduct a content validity study, including how
   to elicit the most from a panel of experts by collecting specific data.
   Instructions on how to calculate a content validity index, factorial
   validity index, and an interrater reliability index and guide for
   interpreting these indices are included. Implications regarding the
   value of conducting a content validity study for practitioners and
   researchers are discussed.},

Abstract = {Social workers have taken large strides in adopting rigorous research
   methods, yet there have been computational advances that could enhance
   the social work knowledge base. This article introduces a computational
   method, agent-based modeling, which can facilitate theoretical and
   methodological innovations by strengthening the alignment of our
   research methods with common social work theories. We review three
   theories, identify how current methods do not allow for the full
   exploration of the social phenomena under investigation, and provide
   justification for using agent-based modeling.},

   of their interventions and to contribute to knowledge building in the
   social sciences. Although social workers have a long tradition of
   practice ethics, less attention has been given to the unique dimensions
   of research ethics for social workers. A social work model of research
   ethics would consider how to balance highly valued ethical principles
   that are individually focused, such as self-determination and
   nonmalfeasance (the obligation to do no harm), with equally important
   values that have a collective focus, such as justice and beneficence
   (the obligation to bring about good). This article reviews current
   principles guiding research ethics, such as autonomy, beneficence,
   nonmalfeasance, and justice and provides an outline of the salient
   issues for social workers as they strive to address individual and
   collective interests in research endeavors, such as a greater emphasis
   on the social justice mission and the need to ensure that social justice
   objectives do not obscure individual rights and freedoms. The article
   concludes with preliminary recommendations for developing a social work
   perspective in research ethics.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Recently, public health networks in Australia have introduced
   clinical research specialists to drive research in the allied health
   professions by helping clinical social workers engage in research. This
   study examines the benefits of a flexible research program for busy
   social work novice and experienced clinicians. Methods: Thirty
   hospital-based social workers were allocated a total of 12 research
   projects. Participants were given a mixed-methods survey both pre and
   post an education program with 17 responses for the presurvey and 12
   responses postsurvey. The responses were coded via thematic analysis.
   Results: Despite initial clinician apprehension, the majority of
   participants found it beneficial. In the busy hospital context, support
   that was valued included simplified information and regular mentorship
   and training. Discussion: The role of a research lead with management
   support is pivotal in promoting a positive research culture and active
   research. However, clinical demand still reduces capacity to engage in
   research.},

Abstract = {This article describes an exploratory qualitative case study using a
   research method novel to social work known as Photovoice. This case
   study of the Photovoice process assesses its value as a community-based
   participatory research (CBPR) method with marginalized communities
   within social work research. Photovoice was used to engage young Black
   men as researchers into their own lived experience. Through a
   photographic and group participatory project, participants discussed how
   intersections of race, gender, and sexuality affect their lives and
   health. While this methodology has proliferated within public health
   literature, little research exists within social work. Photovoice
   represents a research well-aligned with core social work values of
   empowerment and social justice. This method offers our profession a
   participatory, actionoriented tool to inform practice and policy and
   does so in the voices of communities who often go unheard.},

Abstract = {Social workers have traditionally relied upon classical reliability
   theory (CT) to evaluate the consistency of the measures that they
   develop and use.  Generalizability theory (GT), which was developed by
   Cronbach, Gleser, Nanda, and Rajaratnam, has many advantages over CT,
   however.  While CT lumps error into one aggregate, GT allows the
   researcher to identify and estimate the magnitude of multiple sources of
   error.  Once these sources have been estimated, GT provides a means for
   measurement designs to be modified to minimize error.  This paper
   outlines the advantages of GT over CT, and emphasizes how GT better
   allows for the expression of social work values in measurement.  The
   addition of GT to social work curricula is recommended.},

Abstract = {The following question was posed, has social science research helped or
   harmed us? Social work research was used for the purpose of
   illustration. Three hazards of applying social work basic research were
   outlined: (1) It is bias (reflecting the left-leaning values of many
   academics) and leads to the reduction in our freedoms; (2) the social
   work bias is rooted in a supposed moral high ground called social
   justice; and (3), the voice of the non-academics becomes deflated, as
   epistemic elitism is used to foist views upon us by the political class,
   undermining common cultures. On the heels of the three points,
   conclusions were offered to consider if any moderating factors exist to
   address the concern about the loss of freedoms discussed.},

Abstract = {Consumer participation in decision making and evaluation of services has
   been a significant theme in social work and other caring professions for
   over 20 years. This article reflects on a qualitative research study
   that was conceptualised within participatory principles. It critically
   examines key features that emerged as challenges to the ideals of
   participatory research with parents and grandparents about their
   experiences with child protection services in Victoria, Australia.
   Findings The features examined are differentiated between the visible
   and familiar and the invisible, often emergent, aspects of social work
   research. We critically examine the ways in which the visible and
   invisible features as situated dimensions of social work research may
   shape how and whether the ideals of participatory research can be
   achieved. We discuss tensions in the process that have no clear
   solutions'. Instead, we identify the importance of mindfulness and
   reflexive practice by researchers to find their way through these
   potential ethical and legal minefields.
   Applications We conclude that while social workers must continue to
   strive for participation by a range of service users in knowledge
   generation, we must also critically examine and theorise the meaning of
   participatory research and the idealised images of consumers and service
   users to improve such practice. An awareness of situated ethics as a
   location of the self in interaction with others is essential to promote
   ongoing reflexive practice throughout all stages of research.},

   analytic potential of image-based research in social work. Insight
   gained from a qualitative research study that used a novel form of
   participatory diagramming to examine the racial identity development of
   ten multiracial individuals is referenced and critiqued. Utilizing a
   critical visual methodological framework to analyze visual timelines,
   this article offers insight into the contextually rich and dynamic
   processes comprising the multiracial experience. This article concludes
   with an informative discussion of how visual methods support key social
   work values, including commitment to clients and understanding the
   person-in-environment, and how participatory diagramming in particular
   can enhance culturally sensitive and responsible research and practice
   with multiracial individuals.},

Abstract = {Research is an integral part of the social work curriculum even though
   social work students and practitioners can perceive research as detached
   academia with little or no relevance to everyday practice. D'Cruz and
   Jones have highlighted the negative attitude that prevails among social
   work students and practitioners towards social research {[}1]. US-based
   literature indicates that social work students' reluctance, dread and
   anxiety about research is a dilemma for social work education
   internationally {[}2]-{[}5]. In trying to address this apparent learning
   lethargy in the classroom, this paper traces my endeavours to ignite a
   spark of research interest among a small group of social work students.
   This paper showcases how social work education offers fertile ground to
   develop community-based participatory group research in order to connect
   universities, academics and students with the communities surrounding
   them.
   This paper demonstrates how experience-based learning in social work
   education, and the emancipatory and social justice values underpinning
   the profession, align with the community-based learning that `engaged'
   research affords social work students. Community-based learning is
   credited with advancing student skills, personal growth, confidence, and
   citizenship {[}6]. I will describe my methodological approach to
   teaching and learning which focuses on nurturing a reflective,
   discursive, formative, collective and collaborative learning space for
   student researchers. Collaborative engagement with community
   organizations fosters experiential learning for students, communities
   and for social work educators.
   Jacobson and Rugeley assert that community-based group research
   `provides an exceptionally good fit with the value base of the social
   work profession where integrity, valuing human relationships and
   self-determination are integral aspects of how social justice translates
   into practice' {[}7 p.35]. This paper reiterates this assertion and
   demonstrates how group research projects offer the potential to expand
   research education strategies in social work education. Social Work
   research dissertations are almost always individualized tasks where
   students take individual responsibility for their motivation, engagement
   and ethical conduct. In this paper, I suggest that group research
   project challenge students to enhance their research capabilities beyond
   the learning opportunities that individual projects offer. This new
   pedagogical approach allows for social work research education to
   intersect with other elements of professional formation and
   service-learning - developing their skills and capacities to act
   collectively and in solidarity with communities and `experts through
   experience'.
   The paper celebrates the possibility of developing `engaged' student
   social work research from individual projects into group-oriented,
   collaborative exercises in scholarly research activity. In this regard,
   it offers a methodological development in capacity-building for both
   social work students and community organizations, and shows how student
   research, undertaken collaboratively facilitates the use of knowledge
   for change {[}8].},

Title = {`There is no future with no acknowledgement of the
   past'-phenomenological approach in analysing postgraduate studies in
   social work in Estonia},
Journal = {SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION},
Abstract = {This article focuses on the development of academic social work in
   Estonia by analysing 15 doctoral dissertations on social work undertaken
   by Estonian social work scientists between 1991 and 2018. The
   phenomenological approach to interpretive studies focuses on the
   question of how those doctorate studies perceive social work as a
   profession and field for practice-based research. Although many are not
   explicitly concerned with epistemological questions or with positioning
   social work as a profession in Estonian society as such, 10 out of the
   15 studies are geared towards social work practice and all studies
   explain their research methodology. The nine practice-oriented studies
   are qualitative studies, lacking an outspoken, clear idea about the
   specific character or epistemology of social work research except for
   the last one, defended in 2018. PhD researchers witness the development
   of social work as it evolves from a helping profession into a more
   self-confident profession, with its own core values and tasks and
   positioned on the same level as other front-line professionals.},

Title = {Narrative reconstruction and post-traumatic growth among trauma
   survivors: The importance of narrative in social work research and
   practice},
Journal = {QUALITATIVE SOCIAL WORK},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2, SI},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A substantial body of theoretical work on meaning-making processes
   postulates that assisting clients in reconstructing their personal
   narratives in the aftermath of trauma helps survivors to integrate the
   traumatic experience into their identities and life stories. However,
   the relationship between trauma survivors' (re-)construction of a
   coherent life narrative and their development of post-traumatic growth
   (PTG) has rarely been explored. In this study, I conducted life story
   interviews with 46 university students with trauma histories to examine:
   (1) How, and to what degree, trauma survivors (re-)construct a coherent
   life narrative; and (2) If and how this process is connected to the
   development of PTG. I found that survivors who were able to articulate a
   coherent story about their lives experienced more PTG, and I identified
   key characteristics of three stages of post-trauma change. I also found
   that trauma-related therapy, writing, informal conversations, and
   self-reflection played important roles in the narrative reconstruction
   process. I argue that some narratives are easier to reconstruct than
   others because not all narratives are equally valued in society. The
   presence or absence of narratives in the discursive environment, the
   reception these stories receive within society, and the access that
   individuals have to these narratives are influenced by the historical
   moment, social norms, politics, power, privilege, and individuals'
   social locations. To promote empowerment and social justice, social
   workers should help trauma survivors to reconstruct their life stories,
   create spaces for the less-welcomed narratives, and engage in mezzo- and
   macro-level efforts to address social problems and inequalities.},

Abstract = {This article is the last of four in a debate between a critical
   rationalist (falsificationist) and a positivist (justificationist) about
   the value and utility of theory in social work. The critical rationalist
   position and its criticism of the positivist approach to theory and the
   pursuit of science in social work are reviewed and explained in seven
   theses and a little commentary. Some criticisms about how critical
   rationalists choose among theories and interventions are answered.
   Finally, the use and misuse of quasi-experimental research in social
   work are addressed briefly.},

Abstract = {Social workers face complex challenges that demand practice-engaged
   research and research-engaged practice. Participatory action research
   and community-based participatory research span the boundaries that
   often exist between the research and practice communities. Some social
   workers argue the values underpinning participatory action research and
   community-based participatory research align with the values of the
   profession; however, such methodologies are not widely represented in
   social work research in the US. This article presents the findings of a
   study examining the lived experiences of 15 early-career scholars,
   mostly based in the US, who were pursuing participatory action research
   and community-based participatory research. The neoliberalisation of the
   academy pervaded their experiences, presenting significant barriers to
   their ability to pursue action-oriented methodologies. Review of the
   international participatory action research literature also suggests the
   US may contrast with other regions in the world like Asia and Latin
   America, where participatory action research is more robust.
   Recommendations to better develop participatory action research social
   work literature are offered.},

Abstract = {The authors draw on a case study evaluation of two networked cohorts of
   practitioner-researchers in a children's services national social work
   agency in one of the home countries of the United Kingdom. The aim of
   the present study was to understand the meaning of practitioner research
   for social work professionals through an exploration of how language,
   ascriptions of meaning, and interpretation provide a social environment
   through which the nature and meaning of practitioner research emerge.
   The authors used a moderate symbolic interactionist approach to analyze
   diverse qualitative data. The findings suggest it is possible to trace a
   weft of analytic ideas regarding language, memory, moral accountability,
   ownership, meaning, value, and social work practice as they run
   horizontally across the experience of the practitioner-as-researcher.
   The elements of practitioner research have to be understood as being
   interwoven and bringing together and containing different career and
   life concerns that otherwise might remain scattered. The implications of
   this research suggest that practitioner research should not be seen as a
   less or more comfortable add-on to everyday core practice, but as a
   multiform activity that challenges the taken-for-grantedness of
   practice, mainstream academic research, management and, in all
   likelihood, the experience of receiving services.},

   institutional ethnography, a strategy for studying institutions wh ich
   is based on feminist standpoint theory. The author holds that the use of
   institutional ethnography in social work research is congruent with
   social work principles and effective in producing knowledge which can
   inform practice. Discussion of a study of Canadian social work education
   from the standpoint of gay men illustrates this argument. Implications

Abstract = {Researchers and practitioners in social work value qualitative research
   for the opportunity to engage with issues of social justice including
   relations of power, and attention to the political, historical and
   social relations of difference. Interview narratives are all too often
   accepted at face value as authentic, true voice, representing experience
   without analysis of what is being represented politically. An analysis
   of the relations and operations of power provides additional contextual
   insight to face-value analyses with further opportunities for
   understanding and social change. When left uninterrogated, face-value
   analyses are permeable to the reproduction of knowledge without critical
   analyses of race, ability, sexual orientation or gender and can
   perpetuate modernist ideas that knowledge is observable and transparent
   and (re) institutes Western/Eurocentric knowledge as dominant/superior.
   This paper explores critical reflections on our research and provides a
   discussion of some of the opportunities identified from our research
   experiences. Through a discussion of the representation of voice as a
   production in progress; an attention to analyses for historical, social
   and political positioning; and a critique of face-value analyses, a
   conceptual framework is offered that may assist researchers to resist
   reliance on or accepting of analyses as transparent that eludes an

Abstract = {This article offers the perspectives of deans and directors of schools
   and programs of social work on public impact scholarship. Our aim is to
   identify opportunities for social work to make greater public impact as
   a discipline. We extend the definition of public impact scholarship
   beyond translation and dissemination to include research questions and
   methods. We review institutional challenges to public impact
   scholarship-including university culture, levers for impact (or lack
   thereof), and academic values-and discuss promising approaches to the
   promotion of public impact scholarship through mentorship, direct
   support, promotion and tenure, and capacity building.},

Abstract = {The corruption of the social work enterprise is not simply episodic but
   systemic and long-standing including education, research, governance,
   and practice. Reform is unlikely since the constituency within the field
   and outside of it that wishes to change the situation is small and
   ineffective. The corruption of social work reflects the unfortunate
   social values of the nation that refuses to allocate sufficient
   resources to address deep social problems, notably economic and social
   inequality. Social work should severely cut back: eliminate bachelor of
   social work programs and reduce master's education to no more than 20
   programs that also offer doctorates but only jointly with social science
   departments. There are too many social workers and not enough good ones.},

Journal = {HEALTH \& SOCIAL WORK},

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {Historically, African Americans have resisted participation in clinical
   trials and other research projects because of distrust of the mostly
   white research establishment. Although there are legitimate reasons for
   refusing to join clinical trials, most notably the abuses of the
   Tuskegee Syphilis Study, African Americans may be passing up
   opportunities to obtain needed medications years before they reach the
   market. This article analyzes 29 empirical articles from medical and
   mental health journals for their findings on recruiting and maintaining
   African Americans in clinical trials. Reasons for declining and
   accepting opportunities to participate are organized into themes that
   represent the salient findings of these reports. Suggestions for social
   work interventions and changes in research designs are intended to make
   the research process more welcoming to African Americans. Interventions
   are linked to the themes and incorporate social work ethics and values.
   The premise of this study is that African Americans should be offered
   realistic opportunities supported by sufficient resources to increase
   participation.},

Abstract = {In this article, we offer a primer on ``classical{''} frequentist
   statistics. In doing so, we aim to (1) provide social workers with a
   nuanced overview of common statistical concepts and tools, (2) clarify
   ways in which these ideas have oft been misused or misinterpreted in
   research and practice, and (3) help social workers better understand
   what frequentist statistics can and cannot offer. We begin broadly,
   starting with foundational issues in the philosophy of statistics. Then,
   we outline the Fisherian and Neyman-Pearson approaches to statistical
   inference and the practice of null hypothesis significance testing. We
   then discuss key statistical concepts including alpha, power, p values,
   effect sizes, and confidence intervals, exploring several common
   misconceptions about their use and interpretation. We close by
   considering some limitations of frequentist statistics and by offering
   an opinionated discussion on how social workers may promote more
   fruitful, responsible, and thoughtful statistical practice.},

Abstract = {This article describes the establishment of a research unit as an
   integral part of a hospital social work department on the basis of the
   authors' experience in a cancer center over a 13-year period Methods are
   described for building support within the institution, for the process
   of initiating the unit, for deciding on study topics, and finally for
   bridging the gap between clinical and research staff. The evolution of
   the relationship between clinical and research staff was characterized
   by four different phases: curiosity, competitiveness, cooperation, and
   collaboration. A childhood bereavement project is used to exemplify the
   develop mental processes and the ongoing interaction of research and
   clinical staff. The professional practice of all staff benefited from
   the increased academic rigor and productivity, although some staff
   remained unconvinced Of the value of such a major research effort. The
   benefits and costs of the unit are also discussed.},

Abstract = {The Summary This article presents the results of a survey on public
   attitudes and knowledge about social workers in Israel. Data were
   collected by means of structured questionnaires from a convenience
   sample of 1,417 participants aged 21 and older not treated by social
   services.
   Findings The findings indicate that side by side with fairly high
   recognition of general areas related to the social work profession,
   there was a certain lack of comprehension in regard to the roles
   performed by social workers. Attitudes toward social workers were
   ambivalent. Although on most parameters examined they received the
   lowest rankings of all professional fields with which they were
   compared, a fairly high percentage of respondents rejected critical and
   biased statements about social workers and defined them as people whose
   work is based on values, social ideology, and professional ethics, and
   also believed that it is necessary to increase the number of social
   workers in Israel and to improve their employment terms and conditions.
   Applications Understanding public attitudes and knowledge about social
   workers is important in terms of the public's trust in them and the
   prediction of whether they will be approached for advice, treatment, or
   help when necessary. Furthermore, social workers' ability to defend
   their interests and promote social policies requires wide public
   support, without which they will find it hard to attain sufficient
   social and political power and influence.},

Abstract = {The article attempts to characterize social work students in higher
   education institutes in Israel, regarding professional socialization and
   the development of commitment to the profession during their BA
   (undergraduate) studies, lasting three years. This longitudinal study
   included a sample of 450 students in four social work schools. Data was
   gathered throughout four time periods: during the first two weeks of the
   academic year and at the end of each academic year.
   Findings Students, during the first academic year, harbor certain
   misconceptions about the profession, leading to a sharp decrease in
   their commitment to the profession. However, it seems that supervisors,
   teachers and decisionmakers in social work schools somehow manage to
   bring the fantasies entertained by students at the beginning of their
   studies into line with reality, leading to both higher and stronger
   commitment to the profession by the time they complete their BA degree.
   Applications The article discusses the findings and their implications
   on the social work profession, in general, and on social work training,
   in particular, regarding the development of commitment to the profession
   over the years.},

Abstract = {In a recent issue of Families in Society, Caputo argues for the
   ``centrality{''} of peer review in the cultivation of social work
   knowledge. Specifically, he favors the double-blind model of peer
   review. In this paper, I argue that social work should adopt a more
   dynamic set of reviewing practices. First, I define some terminology and
   discuss the limitations of the current double-blind model. Then, I
   describe recent trends in peer review, which I argue foster a more
   robust and open system. I frame this discussion within the context of
   the wider open science movement and urge social workers to engage with
   these scholarly practices. In line with these practices and values, a

Abstract = {Numerous research studies have addressed the experiences and outcomes of
   youth transitioning out of foster care; however, far fewer have
   addressed how to overcome the challenge of locating and retaining
   research participants from this population. This article contributes to
   the field by highlighting effective approaches to staying connected with
   (i.e., recruiting, relocating, and retaining) youth participants in
   longitudinal research studies. Two hundred ninety-four youth in the
   Southeastern United States participated in a longitudinal research study
   about their experiences as they transitioned out of foster care. Two
   years later, 80\% of eligible participants from the baseline population
   (n=223) chose to participate in the second wave of data collection.
   Findings Case examples are presented to illustrate the practical
   applications of youth-centered and person-centered approaches to
   participant recruitment, relocation, and retention and how engaging with
   youth on a case by case basis can minimize attrition rates and maintain
   participant interest in the study.
   Application We affirm the importance of encouraging youth involvement in
   all phases of the research process, highlight the methodological
   approaches used to recruit, relocate, and retain participants, and
   discuss the value of establishing and maintaining meaningful connections
   with youth participants involved in longitudinal research.},

Abstract = {The positivist paradigm that defined scientific social work research
   from 1949 to 1981 has failed to engender research that most
   practitioners find useful. Positivist criteria for valuable research
   require that practitioners; conform to restrictive methodologies that
   are incompatible with other social work values and with most casework
   models. To remedy those inadequacies, social workers increasingly are
   turning to the heuristic paradigm, an up-to-date, scientific philosophy
   of research that draws from contemporary philosophy of science and
   cultural, cognitive, and linguistic studies and that endorses research
   as a tool for advocacy. To indicate the need for the new approach, the
   deleterious effects of social work researchers' adoption of the
   positivist paradigm are described, and reasons why positivism has been
   rejected by researchers in other disciplines are summarized. Fundamental
   concepts of the heuristic paradigm are elaborated on, with an emphasis
   on how the new conceptual foundations can facilitate a fruitful marriage
   of practice and research that will engender sound, relevant, important
   knowledge.},

Abstract = {Along with other helping professions, social work is today struggling to
   become a more ``evidence-based{''} activity. This article explores some
   of the issues raised by this reevaluation of social work, especially as
   it relates to the issue of direct social work practice. Despite the
   current push to base social work helping methods on scientific results
   ({''}hard{''} data), social workers in direct practice continue to rely
   heavily on qualitative evidence from nonscientific sources ({''}soft{''}
   data) in their daily work. The author explores the main sources and
   categories of soft data typically encountered in direct practice and
   analyzes the ways in which practitioners can seek to determine the value
   and usefulness of such evidence in their daily work.},

Title = {Looking back to look forward: a collaborative autoethnographic study of
   the effects of neoliberalism on social work practice, education and
   research},
Journal = {CRITICAL AND RADICAL SOCIAL WORK},
Abstract = {Neoliberalism emerged as a powerful force across the globe, adding
   market-based pressures to social work practice, education and research.
   Using a collaborative autoethnographic approach, we reflected on
   neoliberalism's impact on our professional and academic experiences in
   US-based social work. Disconnection characterised our collective
   experiences of neoliberal social work across practice, research and
   education. The effects of this collective disconnecting emerged in three
   themes: (1) commodification; (2) compliance; and (3) disillusionment. We
   offer recommendations on how the field of social work can resist
   neoliberalism's effects and encourage: (1) recentring social work
   practice, education and research around social work values; (2) a
   strategic use of self to form connections between the personal and the
   professional; and (3) the adoption of collective impact as the model for
   social work education and research.},

Abstract = {The study objective was the identification of social workers' ethic
   profiles in their professional interventions. To conduct this pilot
   study, we used data from a national survey (N = 1071) carried out in
   Spain. The information was collected through an online questionnaire.
   Findings Results show that social workers face a variety of ethical
   dilemmas in their professional practice. Through exploratory factor
   analysis, it was revealed that the underlying structure of the
   questionnaire consisted of three categories: direct service to
   individuals and families, design and implementation of social welfare
   policy and programmes and relationships among professional colleagues.
   Through latent class analysis, four unique social workers' ethical
   profiles were identified: professionals with minimum incidence of
   experiencing ethical dilemmas, professionals with low incidence of
   experiencing ethical dilemmas, professionals with a notable incidence of
   experiencing ethical dilemmas and, finally, professionals with high
   incidence of experiencing ethical dilemmas. A third of the social
   workers in the sample showed a very low probability to be conflicted by
   ethical dilemmas. Applications The pilot study is expected to serve as a
   catalyst for discussion of social workers' ethical conduct and
   professional practice, to promote professional ethics training and
   education and to support the development of professional guidelines.},

Abstract = {Choosing the most appropriate method to handle missing data during
   analyses is one of the most challenging decisions confronting
   researchers. Often, missing values are just ignored rather than replaced
   with a reliable imputation method. Six methods of data imputation were
   used to replace missing data from two data sets of varying sizes; this
   article examines the results. Each imputation method is defined, and the
   pros and cons of its use in social science research are identified. The
   authors discuss comparisons of descriptive measures and multivariate
   analyses with the imputed variables and the results of a timed study to
   determine how long it took to use each imputation method on first and
   subsequent use. Implications for social work research are suggested.},

Abstract = {Mastery of qualitative research and its methods can be a challenge for
   doctoral students who often have had more academic course exposure and
   practical experience with quantitative research. Qualitative courses
   frequently provide a theoretical preliminary understanding, but it is
   the rich ``on-the-ground{''} experience of doing research that
   synthesizes the learning, allowing a student to fully appreciate
   qualitative research as their own. This article presents the experience
   of a doctoral advisor and a student in the process of coaching a
   qualitative dissertation. Individual reflexivity, dialogic meaning
   making, and meeting notes from the dissertation process comprise the
   data sources for this inquiry. The instructor's teaching approach is
   discussed as well as the student's knowledge, values, and skills
   employed during the learning process. Additionally, two ethical dilemmas
   encountered by the student are examined, as well as use of a newly
   minted special education PhD as a qualitative research consultant.
   Technological tools such as Skype and Dropbox were used to bridge the
   geographical distance between their locations. Both the advisor and
   student offer insight into the experience, highlighting what worked well
   for them, lessons learned, and recommendations for future
   student/instructor dyads. The student finished his dissertation in four
   semesters, and won an ``Outstanding Dissertation{''} Award, and is now
   cowriting subsequent journal articles with his dissertation chair. Thus,
   it is concluded that teaching qualitative research during the
   dissertation process creates a bridge between graduate course work and
   the practical application of qualitative methodology, in order to
   transition doctoral students to early career PhD-level researchers.},

Title = {Beyond ``Common Sense{''}: The Role of Local Knowledge in Youth
   Residential Treatment},

Abstract = {Social work scholars have challenged the reliance on so-called ``common
   sense{''} to guide clinical practice. This article reports findings from
   an ethnographic study of knowledge use and decision making in a
   residential treatment center (RTC) for children. Specifically, it asks
   what knowledge informs the everyday practice of mental health workers
   and analyzes participants' assertions that expert practice requires the
   possession of what they refer to as ``common sense.{''} Approximately
   1,560 hours of participant observation and 36 semistructured interviews
   were conducted with 78 consenting mental health workers at the
   participating RTC. Participants reported that they valued and relied on
   common sense in their everyday practice and emphasized it in assessments
   of others' expertise. They described common sense as a natural quality
   of individuals, not learnable through professional education or
   on-the-job training. These assertions that practice expertise requires
   common sense obscure a rich body of local knowledge that workers drew on
   in practice. Common sense is more accurately understood as site-specific
   local knowledge calibrated to the unique demands of the organization.
   Further study of the character and transmission of local knowledge may
   inform social work research, education, and practice with implications
   for models of clinical decision making and knowledge transfer within and
   between organizations.},

Abstract = {This article explores the discourses employed by social work educators
   in their constructions of social work identity, practice and education.
   The research data for this qualitative study was collected from in-depth
   interviews with social work educators from two South Australian
   universities, who were eligible for membership with the Australian
   Association of Social Workers.
   Findings: Using Gee's discourse analysis framework, the key discourses
   used by social work educators to construct social work, social workers,
   clients and social work educational institutions are identified. Social
   work educators drew on professional, helping/caring, emancipatory and
   social control discourses to highlight the typical' story of social
   work' and construct social workers and social work educators as a who
   doing a what', to distinguish social work from other professions.
   Application: Despite being constructed as having the power to act as
   gate keepers' to the profession, very little research examines how
   social work educators reflect on their practice as social workers and
   social work educators. Further national and international research is
   required to examine how social work students, service users, employers
   and other disciplines interpret these social work discourses.},

Abstract = {While social work must be evaluative in relation to its diverse areas of
   practice and research (i. e., values- informed research), the purpose of
   this article is to propose that values are within the scope of research
   and therefore research on practice should make values a legitimate
   object of investigation (i. e., research-informed values). In this
   article, the fact/value debate in social work research is considered by
   offering reflection on the history and philosophy of this debate and by
   offering summary thoughts on how social work must engage with
   normativity (i. e., the ought, what matters most to people, and how the
   world and people matter) so the debate moves beyond mere questions about
   the relevance of values to the questions we ask, the methodologies we
   engage, the theories we promote, the interventions we support, our
   engagements with our many and diverse publics, and the investigation of
   values as causes.},

   community and the often rapid and reactive social innovation community
   to best respond to societal needs. From an emerging scholar's point of
   view, it concludes by emphasizing how shifting priorities in social work

Abstract = {Statistical paradigms limit the perspective and tools social work
   researchers use to study the world and answer questions impacting people

   overwhelmingly rely on the frequentist paradigm of statistics. This
   paper discusses foundational differences between the frequentist and
   Bayesian statistical paradigms, describes basic concepts of Bayesian
   analysis, compares Bayesian and frequentist statistical analysis for a
   sample social work problem, and introduces two types of causal analyses
   built on Bayesian statistical thinking: counterfactual causality, and
   causality based on work by computer scientist Judea Pearl. Implications
   for social work research are discussed.},

Abstract = {In this essay, the authors consider the challenge made by two keynote
   speakers at recent social work research conferences, one in the United
   States and the other in Europe. Both spoke of a knowledge crisis in
   social work. Both John Brekke (Society for Social Work and Research) and
   Peter Sommerfeld (First Annual European Conference for Social Work
   Research) proposed some version of realism as a solution to the crisis.
   The authors will deepen the argument for realism, however, by discussing
   how a critical realist perspective allows us to rethink positivist and
   conventionalist assumptions about the fact/value relation. Using a
   critical realist philosophy of social science, the authors discuss how
   social work has taken up positivism and myriad forms of conventionalism
   and also identify how practical knowledge gradually loses its place and
   thus contribute to social work's ongoing knowledge crisis. The authors
   then offer a way of thinking about practice. The authors will consider
   forms of practice knowledge and propose that social work has four kinds
   that unfold in essentially open systems: discursive, visual, embodied,
   and liquid systems, and that each of these have both tacit and explicit
   dimensions. These forms of practice, moreover, are inevitably situated
   in theory-to-practice gaps (the authors call them phenomenological
   practice gaps), which are the source of social work's knowledge crisis.
   The authors conclude with a discussion of the role of reflexivity in a
   science of social work.},

Abstract = {Coding social work practice in research studies can present a number of
   challenges for researchers aiming to break down elements of practice
   into variables. Using as an example, a completed study that investigated
   social work interventions in cancer care, the paper explores coding
   challenges that arose for social work researchers using a national
   classification system for social work in health. The benefits and
   limitations of using these codes, and the research design strategies
   that were used to overcome some of these limitations are discussed. A
   composite case example from the study is used to illustrate the
   challenges of capturing case complexity. A concluding critical appraisal
   of social work practice in health suggests that interpretive, contextual
   practice can sit alongside bio-psychosocial frameworks. The translation
   of professional practice for classification systems requires ongoing
   input that includes cultural and ontological stances to ensure
   meaningful representation of the social circumstances of patients and
   social work practice. This paper contains an anonymised, composite case
   example derived from data collected in a research project. Aboriginal
   and Torres Strait Islander people should be aware that the case involves
   a young Aboriginal woman who died in hospital as a result of her cancer.
   IMPLICATIONS Social work is a profession that is understood through
   context, values, world views, and critical reflection. Challenges arise
   for social work researchers when practice is classified in context-free
   information systems. Opportunities to mould classification systems
   enable more meaningful conceptualisations of practice that support
   understandings of the complexities of the work.},

Pages = {276-287},
Abstract = {Researchers have established that individuals' abortion knowledge is
   positively associated with their support of abortion rights. However,
   social workers' personal beliefs regarding abortion are
   under-researched, even though social workers are often employed in
   health promotion and education roles in which the topic of abortion is
   encountered. The current study examines the results of a nationwide
   survey of social work students (N=504) and explores the relationship
   between social work students' abortion knowledge and abortion attitudes.
   Less abortion knowledge was significantly associated with antichoice
   attitude endorsement. Implications for social work research, training,
   and education are subsequently discussed.},

Abstract = {In this study, youth residents of the Mathare community of Nairobi,
   Kenya documented individual and community strengths using photovoice, a
   method that is grounded in the principles of community-based
   participatory research. Research was conducted in collaboration with the
   Mwelu Foundation, a youth-based participatory photography organization
   in Mathare. Template analysis was used to code the data, and
   industriousness, positive identity, community resources, and resilience
   emerged as the identified individual and community strengths. The
   project highlighted the value of photovoice for promoting empowerment
   and highlighting the perspectives of largely invisible populations.
   Implications of photovoice for social work research and practice are

Abstract = {Social work today faces a crucial watershed: Will the field continue to
   promulgate unsound and detrimental beliefs about social work research
   and knowledge, or will the field fully embrace the heuristic paradigm
   and thereby realize its true potential as a first-rate science committed
   to humanistic Ideals? Proponents of unsound and detrimental beliefs have
   obscured the choice for soda{[} workers by systematically and thoroughly
   misrepresenting the heuristic paradigm, making unwarranted and
   misleading claims for the paradigms to which It Is opposed (logical
   empiricism and relativism), and confusing the issues at stake for the
   field. Accordingly, this article helps social workers recognize the
   tenets and implications of each of the three paradigms for research that
   social work has available to it-the heuristic paradigm, logical
   empiricism, and relativism-so that social workers can make a truly
   informed choice about the best approach to knowledge in their field.},

Abstract = {Dramatic changes in demography, epidemiology, and the financing and
   delivery of health care have significantly affected the lives of older
   adults and their families. The authors review current and future trends
   in aging and health care in the United States and their implications for
   social work practice in enhancing the health and well-being of older
   adults and their caregivers. Health care social work in the 21st century
   requires the development and application of evidence-based knowledge
   that reflects the interrelatedness of aging, physical and mental health,
   and intergenerational family processes. The authors demonstrate the
   value of social work research to issues that are in the forefront of
   gerontological health care practice, policy, and education.},

   counsellor must possess, and to develop these skills in the students
   attending the undergraduate study programs Psychology and Social Work.
   Research methods: Super's work values inventory scale, Questionnaire
   about the necessity of learning skills of students as counsellors, A
   focus group with students from both specializations. Conclusions: Among
   several aspects involved, the concept of `diversity' implies individual
   recognition of group differences, treating people as individuals and
   valuing heterogeneity in school, community, and at the work place. In
   this way, the premises for understanding and respecting each human being
   and each group may be ensured. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {Longhofer and Floersch argue for more expansive thinking about the modes
   of social science research predominant in contemporary social work
   science. This commentary concurs with aspects of their article that we
   see as compatible both with social work aims and with current trends and
   imperatives in research and practice, including mixed methods and
   participatory studies, translational research, the scholarship of
   engagement, and rapidly emerging interest in collective impact. At the
   same time, it encourages the authors to extend their analyses by
   grounding them more thoroughly in the specifics of contemporary social
   work research, encouraging collective dialogue about the implications of
   their proposals, and recognizing that contemporary transdisciplinary and
   translational research endeavors are typically more fully aligned with
   these proposals than this article allows.},

Abstract = {The future of social work research relies on the intellect and
   competence of current doctoral students. These future scholars who
   receive doctoral education that values qualitative inquiry will create a
   system where qualitative research traditions receive the same privilege
   as quantitative research traditions. Project-based learning provides
   learning opportunities that can challenge assumptions about what
   academia considers ``real{''} research. This descriptive qualitative
   study explored key attributes of using project-based learning within two
   consecutive social work doctoral courses to encourage qualitative
   research skill development. Students and instructors participated in
   ideawriting and focus groups to assess the usefulness of PBL within
   these courses. The findings suggested that PBL may be useful for
   deepening knowledge about qualitative inquiry and reducing
   epistemological unconsciousness.},

Abstract = {Families in the child welfare system who are affected by substance abuse
   face distinct challenges to achieving reunification. Family drug courts
   (FDCs), which are child welfare courts based on a therapeutic framework
   of legal scholarship, arose 2 decades ago as an alternative approach for
   adjudicating these cases. A comprehensive review of prior empirical
   research on FDCs is presented to ascertain whether the model is a best
   practice for this population. The results of this review suggest that
   children in families that are involved in FDCs spend less time in foster
   care and are more likely to achieve reunification. This analysis
   incorporates findings from qualitative literature and undertakes
   methodological and values-based critiques in order to develop
   implications for social work research, practice, and policy.},

Abstract = {Discussion of cultural tension in the social work literature is
   piecemeal. As part of a grounded theory study, this article reports some
   major findings on cultural tensions experienced by 30 frontline social
   workers. Cultural tensions caused by cultural similarities and
   differences among social workers, clients, organizations, and society
   are multifaceted. Social workers, however, are always at the center of
   the tensions. Findings indicate that the social work profession may need
   to consider the neutrality claim of the profession, the different
   experience of ethnic minority social workers, and the need of critical
   reflexivity for reflective practitioners. Implications for social work
   practice, social work education for ethnic minority social workers, and
   social work research are discussed.},

Abstract = {Despite the shift in attitudes in religious institutions toward
   homosexuals in the United States, there are some religions that continue
   to view same-sex behavior as a deviant and damning sin. For many,
   religious beliefs and values provide meaning and impact personal
   identity. Using autoethnography, I will explicate my own experiences
   with religious institutions and the ongoing conflict between religious
   beliefs and sexuality. I will discuss messages received from the
   Pentecostal church, family, and Latino community, and how these messages
   influenced my human development and emotional well-being. I show that
   internalization of the principles taught by the Pentecostal Church
   triggered a conflict when I became aware of my homosexuality. In this
   article, I discuss the mental health challenges I faced, and strategies
   I used to reconcile conflicting identities. I also discuss the use of
   autoethnography in social work and its implications in social work

Abstract = {Social work research and practice that address environmental
   sustainability have already become prominent. However, a change in
   unsustainable economic structures is also urgently needed. This study
   explored emerging opportunities in theory and practice for a sustainable
   economy that are relevant to the aims of social work. As practical
   examples, our study concerns `ecosocial innovations', i.e., social
   innovations that combine ecological and social goals. We analysed how
   these grassroots innovations in the field of social work reflect crucial
   shared conceptions of alternative economies. The qualitative data set
   comprised of 50 ecosocial innovations and six case studies in five
   European countries. The findings show a rich diversity of ecosocial
   innovations and describe how they reframe economic purposes, value
   economic diversity and democratise the economy. We suggest that social
   work might consider these practices as opportunities for collaboration,
   especially regarding work with people on the margins of the labour
   market.},

Abstract = {The social work profession has made tremendous contributions to youth
   well-being, laying the foundation for social welfare systems and child
   protection laws. However, deficit-based constructions of youth are
   deeply engrained in the profession. Social work researchers have called
   for attention to critical approaches like youth participatory action
   research (YPAR). YPAR has an action-oriented epistemology and engages
   youth as coresearchers, providing an opportunity to shift social work
   research and practice paradigms. Yet, social work scholars lag behind
   cognate disciplines in adopting YPAR. This article examines challenges
   that have stymied YPAR in social work. The authors review the historical
   roots of the profession and its relationship to youth; examine present
   challenges, including social work's training and career progression; and
   make suggestions for the future, calling social work to affirm our
   values by reevaluating the way we do research on youth, the way we train
   future social workers, and the paradigms driving our practice.},

Abstract = {Compared to cancers at other sites, lung cancer often results in greater
   psychosocial distress to both the patients and their caregivers, due to
   the poor prognosis and survival rate, as well as the heavy symptom
   burden. In recent years, making protocols of proposed or on-going
   studies publicly available via clinical trial registries and/or
   peer-reviewed journals has benefited health sciences with timely
   communication of the latest research trends and improved transparency in
   reporting. However, such practice is yet to be a common sight in
   evidence-informed social work. Hence, this paper discusses the value of
   publishing protocols in social work research and presents the protocol
   of a randomized controlled trial that compares the effectiveness of
   integrative body-mind-spirit intervention with cognitive behavioral
   therapy for enhancing quality of life of patients with lung cancer and
   their family caregivers. The data collection process was still on-going
   at the time of manuscript submission.},

Abstract = {Qualitative research ethics discussions have established a sound
   knowledge and practice base which advises on the protection and rights
   of the research informants. This paper, although supporting the primacy
   of informant safety, will highlight less visible research debates. The
   potential for vulnerability and harm of the social work researcher will
   be explored. The value Of achieving heightened empathy and emotional
   resonance with research participants is considered as a process which
   the author suggests is likely to increase the richness of the research
   data, but also may accentuate researcher vulnerability or distress. The
   author's experience of doing personal research with vulnerable
   informants, and of being a social work research supervisor, will be used
   to reflect on processes and practices which she claims may make social
   work researchers particularly vulnerable to conflict and distress. Data
   from her recent research which explored the experiences Of social work
   researchers will be used to illustrate these issues.},

Abstract = {Objective: This study examined the extent to which conclusions of
   published outcome studies contain phrases that could be misconstrued as
   implying more empirical support than is warranted. Methods: All articles
   (N = 138) reporting outcome studies from 2000 to 2005 in two social work
   research journals and two topical database searches were assessed
   regarding research design, findings, and wording of conclusions.
   Substantial interrater agreement was indicated by kappa values of .95
   for research design, 1.00 for nature of findings, and .70 for wording of
   conclusions. Results: Of the articles, 70\% used designs that do not
   warrant making conclusive causal inferences, and 60\% of articles with
   those designs contained phrases that could be misconstrued or exploited
   as implying an inflated evidence-based status. Conclusion: To prevent
   evidence-based practice from becoming a meaningless shibboleth, authors,
   reviewers, and editors should become vigilant in avoiding wording that
   could be misconstrued as implying more empirical support than is
   warranted.},

Abstract = {Context:
   In response to the growth of evidence-based practice in social work,
   systematic literature reviews offer significant value to social work but
   are often met with concerns of time scarcity.
   Purpose:
   Through a case study search strategy addressing the research question
   ``What are practicing frontline social workers' experiences of
   bureaucracy?,{''} this article seeks to promote efficiency by providing
   a practical guide for conducting systematic literature searches and an
   appraisal of database performance in qualitative social work research.
   Method:
   The total citations, unique hits, sensitivity, and precision for each
   database were calculated before conducting a cross-study comparison with
   three previously published social work systematic searches to identify
   emerging performance trends.
   Results/Conclusion:
   Relying on a single database is subject to bias and will not provide
   comprehensive or sensitive findings; however, due to consistent high
   performance across four systematic searches, Applied Social Science
   Index and Abstracts, Social Services Abstracts, and Social Science
   Citation Index are recommended for future literature searching in social
   work.},

Abstract = {In this article we will show how a relational approach provides a
   conceptual framework that shapes and informs culturally sensitive
   practice with a severely disturbed client. We argue that a relational
   approach facilitates therapeutic action through the intense focus on
   countertransference, the close attention to enactments, and the
   therapist's authenticity and self-disclosure. Additionally, we emphasize
   that a therapeutic matrix that includes the cultural, racial,
   socioeconomic, and institutional factors, increases the likelihood
   clinicians will attend to what Perez-Foster calls their ``dissociated
   and disavowed personal values.{''} We present a case that had a less
   than satisfactory outcome where the therapist found herself in a ``sea
   of trouble.{''} The case illustrates how a relational approach enhanced
   the therapist's understanding of the case and allowed her to continue to
   work with a difficult and challenging client. We conclude by suggesting
   that our conceptual understanding of this case exemplifies a necessary
   and appropriate focus for future social work research and practice.},

Abstract = {Research engagement can support a social work clinician, manager and
   educator in the complexity of everyday practice however in the hospital
   setting social workers find themselves challenged by the range of
   potential research questions and methodologies that do not align with
   their daily experience, professional values or ways of collaboratively
   working. Four metropolitan hospitals and a university partner worked
   together to explore the impact of a collaborative capacity building
   model on the ability for social workers to engage in research activity.
   Using a Participatory Action Research framework, the research team
   identified the elements that contribute to a non-hierarchical and
   successful research dynamic, as well as the challenges that committing
   to research activity brings in the clinical role. Through reflecting on
   and articulating the pracademic, or practitioner-researcher, model used
   and the dominant values that contribute to social work research this
   study is transferable to other similarly challenged hospital social work
   departments and health settings.},

Abstract = {A strong theme in the social work literature contends that randomized
   experiments are an impractical, inappropriate, unethical, and rarely
   undertaken research method for use in social work. In a test of this
   claim, the author undertook a review of the English-language published
   literature and prepared a provisional bibliography of primary social
   work studies that used experimental methodology. Astonishingly, over 740
   such studies were located, with the first being published in 1949. The
   existence of this large experimental social work literature has been
   largely unrecognized, in part, because much of it has appeared in a
   diverse array of journals associated with other disciplines. It is no
   longer tenable to claim that experiments are either impractical or
   inappropriate as a social work research method of value in making causal
   inferences. This bibliography will be amended in coming years, and
   subsequent analyses of the types of problems and interventions, which
   are the focus of these studies, will add to the empirical foundations of
   social work practice.},

Abstract = {Protecting the health and well-being of workers naturally aligns with
   the social work mission to advance human dignity. The workplace can both
   create and perpetuate health disparities by shaping health and
   well-being at multiple levels and in socially patterned ways. Yet
   workplace issues are rarely on social work research and practice
   agendas. This article serves as a call to action for social work, as a
   discipline, to engage with the workplace as a means of advancing the
   field's core values. It first provides evidence for why engagement with
   workplaces is critical for advancing social justice. It then presents
   evidence for the ways in which workplace exposures and experiences, at
   multiple levels, shape worker health and well-being. Finally, it
   provides concrete steps for how the skills and values of the social work
   profession can be applied to the workplace through research, practice,
   education, and policy efforts, and by extension improve population
   health and well-being.},

   their practice using the language of outcomes. Yet, little research has
   focused on the language that social workers use to describe their
   practice and how they identify appropriate interventions and link them
   to clearly defined evaluative outcomes. This paper is part of a large
   programme of research exploring and identifying issues associated with
   social work practice in the Australian health context. Specifically, the
   paper draws on qualitative data from the first stage of the project that
   explores issues associated with customary social work practice. Findings
   from the paper suggest clear evidence of tensions and difficulties
   experienced by social workers in attempting to communicate the critical
   expertise behind their practice and that practitioners have only
   rudimentary understanding of the concepts of outcomes and evaluation. A
   key challenge for social work research concerns how to encourage the
   profession actively to engage with the outcomes movement whilst
   maintaining the core principles and values of social work.},

Abstract = {In this contribution, we focus on the question of how social workers
   actually deal with the complexity of sharing private information in
   three local networks of social provision that aim to combat child
   poverty. Building on the existing body of social work research, we
   discuss how practices for exchanging private information are enmeshed in
   a field of tension between both regulation and discretion. This
   complexity reveals a major challenge for social workers to justify their
   interventions. Based on a combination of qualitative semi-structured
   interviews with social workers in the network and participant
   observation during the network meetings, we examine the strategies of
   discretion, considerations and potential justifications of social
   workers in dealing with private information. Our analysis reveals three
   major themes: (i) legitimacy to act, (ii) deserving versus undeserving
   families and (iii) powerlessness to collectively act. We conclude that a
   rights-based approach can be crucial as a normative value orientation
   and as a point of reference to enable social workers in justifying how
   and why they exchange private information about families in poverty
   situations.},

Abstract = {The tension between social workers' commitment to values and the
   effectiveness of their interventions has been often observed and has
   affected the relationship between research and practice. The
   evidence-based practice model submits practice to strict positivist
   scrutiny. It suspends or neglects the value laden in the process of
   experimental intervention, and argues for seeking justified universal
   rules or causal-effect relations between variables as the guideline to
   social work intervention. This invokes strong rebuttals from critical
   reflective practice. Critical reflective practice within the
   epistemology of interpretivism highlights multi perspectives from
   different standpoints and tries to substitute universal rules with
   contextual consensus as the solution to social problems facing social
   work. This article borrows practice theory from Giddens and Bourdieu and
   extended case method from Burawoy to elaborate the debate between
   evidence-based practice and reflective practice. We reconstruct the
   reflective practice model, and suggest that social work research and
   practice should be not only mutually dialogued for the transformation of
   interaction situations, but also extended to macro structural and
   institutional factors.},

Abstract = {Finland has a strong and long tradition of research-oriented doctoral
   education in social work. Recent general changes in doctoral education,
   such as increased regulation, internationalisation and time pressures,
   have had an impact on social work as an academic discipline. This
   article examines the recruitment of social work doctoral students and
   the perceived value of doctoral dissertations as academic research. The
   data consist of written responses by Finnish full professors of social
   work to open-ended questions presented in an electronic questionnaire.
   The analysis is based on the idea of `boundary work' within and between
   disciplines, and between science and society and on the professors'
   argumentation and reasoning. The results reveal several ambivalences in
   how the professors see doctoral education and dissertations in social
   work. Today, social work is seen much as any other (neighbouring)
   discipline although with some unique features. According to the
   professors, while the quality of social work dissertations remains good,
   their value as scientific research has decreased. The societal and
   practical relevance of social work research present the discipline with
   a major challenge. The most striking ambivalence concerned the relation
   between research and practice and thus merits further discussion within
   the social work discipline.},

Abstract = {The present review was undertaken to explore recent evidence in the
   professional literature pertaining to use of hospice services by African
   Americans. The article addresses the research methods that have been
   used to study African American hospice use, obstacles to African
   American participation in hospice that have been identified, and
   interventions designed to increase the number of African Americans using
   hospice services that have been tested. Results indicate that both
   qualitative and quantitative methods have identified the following key
   factors that contribute to the underuse of hospice services by members
   of the African American community: personal or cultural values in
   conflict with hospice philosophy, lack of awareness of hospice services,
   concern about burdening family, economic factors, mistrust of the health
   care system, and expected lack of ethnic minority employees in hospice
   agencies. Implications for future social work research and practice with
   terminally ill African Americans and their families include efforts to
   quantitatively determine whether the identified key factors contribute
   significantly in the decisions they make regarding end-of-life care. In
   addition, social work intervention studies are recommended to offer
   tested interventions designed to increase the use of hospice services
   that are cost-effective and culturally competent.},

Abstract = {The contribution that social workers make to communities is integral to
   the principles and values of the profession but is often `hidden' and
   unacknowledged. This paper is an exploration of social workers'
   engagement with community work approaches in a range of settings in the
   Republic of Ireland, where managerialism and a climate of austerity pose
   particular challenges for social work practice. By exploring the
   findings of qualitative interviews with social work practitioners, the
   paper examines themes and issues that emerge in the context of their
   practice settings and considers how community work ideas are enacted in
   contemporary social work practice. These ideas challenge dominant
   discourses and emphasise a process of active engagement with communities
   to counter inequality and injustice and seek change at both community
   and societal levels. The concept of `creative activism' is developed to
   explore the idea of critical practice and the different forms of
   collective action that social workers undertake. The use of these ideas
   to strengthen the links between theory, research and practice on a
   postgraduate qualifying social work degree is discussed. The paper seeks
   to re-emphasise the place of community work within social work research,
   theory, practice and professional education.},

Abstract = {One-third of U.S. adults do not have adequate health literacy to manage
   their health care needs; and low health literacy is a major concern due
   to its association with poor health outcomes, high health care costs,
   and health communication problems. Low health literacy is a potential
   driver of health disparities, and its alleviation is central to the
   values and concerns of the social work profession. Despite the extensive
   knowledge and skills that social workers can bring to bear to assist
   patients with low health literacy, the concept of health literacy is
   underused in social work scholarship.This gap reflects missed
   opportunities for social workers to contribute their expertise to the
   evolving field of health literacy and to strategically align their work
   with organizational and national priorities.To address this gap, this
   article provides an overview of health literacy, its relevance to social
   work, and its representation in disciplinary literature; and it outlines
   opportunities for health social workers to systematically incorporate
   health literacy concepts and tools into their practices with patients
   and families. Implications for a social work research and practice
   agenda in health literacy are discussed.},

Abstract = {In all professional relationships, there are power imbalances and the
   potential for discrimination and exploitation. To safeguard against such
   violations, the concept of professional boundaries is advocated, yet the
   construction of these boundaries is presented as if it is rudimentary
   for everyone. Historically, the professional boundaries created within
   the field of social work have been influenced by other professions, most
   notably medicine. Integral to these traditional models are professional
   boundaries that separate the professional from the client and
   concentrate on what the boundary is, rather than why it is needed and
   how it is created. As a consequence, the professional boundaries within
   social work have become increasingly incongruent with developments in
   the professions unique theoretical and value base. Despite the
   widespread acceptance of the importance of professional boundaries,
   scant attention has been paid to their construction and the degree to
   which they reflect the ethos of the social work profession. This paper
   examines professional boundaries and presents an alternative
   conceptualisation of boundaries in social work relationships. The model
   emphasises connection rather than separation, advocating a process that
   encourages mutuality. Implications for social work research, education
   and practice are also examined.},

Abstract = {Social work research should adopt a critical approach to research
   methodology, opposing oppression that is reproduced through
   epistemological assumptions or research methods and processes. However,
   traditional approaches to autism research have often problematised and
   pathologized autistic (1) individuals, reinforcing autistic people's
   positions as passive subjects. This has resulted in autistic people
   being largely excluded from the production of knowledge about autism,
   and about the needs of autistic people. Participatory approaches promote
   collaborative approaches to enquiry and posit autistic people as active
   co-constructors of knowledge, a stance that is congruent with social
   work values of social justice and liberation. However, Covid-19 is not
   only altering our everyday life but also upending social research. This
   paper discusses the challenges faced by a participatory study involving
   autistic people during the Covid-19 pandemic. This paper examines how
   Covid-19 increased the individual vulnerability of autistic participants
   and changed their research priorities, increased the researcher's
   decision-making power, and placed greater emphasis on barriers created
   by inaccessible methods. Covid-19 did not present novel challenges, but
   rather exacerbated existing tensions and inevitable challenges that are
   inherent in adopting an approach that aims to oppose oppression.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on care leavers' experiences of their transition from
   care to adulthood. Using a social pedagogical perspective, we explore
   continuity and discontinuity in their life course as central aspects of
   support in the transition process. Using biographical narratives of
   three young people with different paths of transition from public care,
   we argue that a successful transition to independent living involves a
   complex interplay of continuity and discontinuity. Our analysis suggests
   a typology of (dis) continuity patterns in the transition to adulthood:
   (i) creating continuity, (ii) transforming continuity, (iii)
   discontinuity by breaking up continuity and (iv) enabling continuity by
   discontinuity. Current discourse in social work research values
   stability in care and continuity in the transition from care as a main
   strategy for successful transition. This perspective on the efforts of
   professionals and institutions, emphasising placement stability,
   disregards the young people's own efforts to create (dis) continuity in
   other aspects of their life. These, we found, can lead to positive
   changes. Our results suggest that, to enhance care leavers' agency to
   cope with transition processes, social work practice should strive to
   understand the client's biographically driven strategies of creating
   (dis) continuity.},

Title = {A triad model of engaged social work pedagogy: connecting research,
   education, and action},
Journal = {SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION},
Abstract = {Social work is troubled by long-standing tensions that emanate from its
   origin as both a practice-based profession and an academic discipline.
   Social work's core social justice values often run counter to
   traditional positivist research and academic education. In academia,
   these tensions appear as educators are called to better prepare students
   for high quality research as well as to implement anti-oppressive (AOP)
   content into their curriculum. This article presents the Triad Model,
   which responds to these dual calls for engaged AOP academia and pedagogy
   by engaging students in anti-oppressive research and community practice.
   We begin by identifying three main challenges for teaching AOP social
   work research. Building on the principles of engaged pedagogy,
   participatory research, and community-academy partnerships, we then
   present a Triad Model that merges research, education, and action. This
   model fosters a holistic approach that entwines the three strands, while
   honoring diverse forms of knowledge and perspectives to promote social
   change. We discuss implications and provide guidelines for educators who
   wish to adopt the Triad Mode in ways that are responsive to their local
   context and pedagogical goals.},

Title = {A deliberative study into the impact of integration on mental health
   social work in England: merely a dialogue or activism?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {77-89},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, to examine the
   impact on mental health social work of integrated care; and second, to
   explore the effectiveness of the use of deliberative research, a
   methodology which is new to mental health social work research.
   Design/methodology/approach Developed to enable examination of policy,
   deliberative research is underpinned by a desire to permit choice and
   change brought about through an iterative dialogue. This communication
   is based on informed and respectful equality between policy makers or
   implementers and those subject to that implementation. In order to
   achieve this equality, participation in debate by participants is viewed
   as essential, including as part of the process, participants becoming
   better informed about the phenomenon in question.
   Findings The findings show that effective mental health social work
   underpins successful integrated care which, in turn, is viewed as
   relevant. In addition, people who access services identified that mental
   health social workers are well positioned as facilitators and explainers
   in integrated care. The issue to be further explored by research,
   therefore, is not whether services should be delivered separately or in
   an integrated way, but how to keep improving and developing integrated
   care and especially the impact of ongoing power differentials.
   Research limitations/implications The use of deliberative research
   worked reasonably well as an underpinning methodology for this study in
   that it sought to achieve the opinions of the public, in this instance
   consumers who provided or accessed mental health social work. The
   ethical need to ensure no harm came to this particular group meant that
   their opinions were not debated with the whole. This limitation to
   iterative dialogue is undoubtedly a consideration when undertaking
   deliberative research on such populations. This study offered just this,
   a one-off event, as in reality the commitment from participants to
   attend more than this one session would have been prohibitive.
   Practical implications The test, practically, comes with the events for
   data collection. This is not just the debate as to whether these, as
   one-off events, bring about agreement and not deliberation, but also
   whether researchers can, with a group that has particular needs,
   effectively integrate them into the deliberation. Given that it is an
   ethical priority to ensure that the participants are not harmed, this is
   not always going to be possible where the public includes those who may
   be vulnerable.
   Originality/value Deliberative research methodology is a new approach in
   mental health social work research. The influential finding is activism:
   people who access services recognise and suggest a challenge to the
   normative power differential in integrated care, as embodied in mental
   health social workers, and it is this aspect that warrants further
   investigation.},

Abstract = {What do the many translations of `the brain' from the domain of
   neuroscience offer to social work researchers? Drawing upon disability
   studies and critical social work, this article examines trends and
   tensions across `neuro' writing in social work journals and summarises
   some commonly recommended practices. Neuroscientific discourse has
   undeniable cultural influence and offers distinctive forms of evidence
   to social workers. Social work scholars have strategically translated
   neuroscience findings to access greater disciplinary status, to counter
   neo-liberal onslaughts on public services, to communicate on
   inter-disciplinary teams and to address calls for `new' scholarship. At
   the same time, many writers readily acknowledge that they use
   neuroscience to justify or even revive well-established social work
   practices and theories. A unidirectional strategy of translation across
   disciplines comes with inherent risks of reinforcing hierarchy, ignoring
   social difference and undermining the value of social work research and
   practice. Neurodiversity discourse offers one example of `neuro'
   argumentation where social justice and neuroscience have intertwined and
   may present an opportunity for a different type of social work
   translation. Social workers should be prepared to engage with
   neuroscience but must do so in ways that consistently reinforce social
   justice commitments and include a wide array of perspectives.},

Abstract = {Critical discourse analysis (CDA) examines the relationship between
   language and power in society. By linking micro, mezzo, and macro
   environments, examining the impact of language on marginalized
   communities, and providing a lens for critical reflection, CDA aligns
   with the frameworks and values of social work as a profession. Yet this
   method has been underutilized in social work research. This paper
   provides an orientation for social work scholars seeking to use CDA
   through discussion of four key ``signposts{''} or decision-making
   points: 1) theoretical framing and rationale, 2) sampling and data
   generation, 3) data analysis, and 4) dissemination of findings. Drawing
   on examples from the authors' experiences with CDA studies addressing
   diverse research topics and methodological decisions, this paper offers
   a wide range of research design strategies for conducting similar
   projects. Examples are varied in terms of theoretical framing, research
   questions, data sources, analytic strategies, and audience. They include
   analyses of neoliberal discourse in refugee policy, discourses of
   culture in international development research documents, constructions
   of bisexuality among older women, and representations of intimate
   partner violence in young adult novels and tweets. Along the way,
   attention is given to communicating about CDA for social work audiences,
   particularly those less familiar with the epistemological foundations of
   CDA and its implications for practice.},

Abstract = {Accounting provides a distinctive conceptual lens to analyse how
   neo-liberal reforms in the public sector operate. Despite this,
   appreciation of the significance of accounting as a key neo-liberal
   instrument of organisational change is only embryonic in social work
   research. Against this background, this article presents the findings of
   an empirical study, conducted across children's services departments at
   three English councils, which illuminates how neo-liberal policies
   inculcate financial responsibilities in social work by examining the
   microprocesses surrounding the application and usage of accounting
   techniques. The instillation of neo-liberal values that underpin the use
   of accounting in social work privileges economic efficiency over those
   emphasising collectivism and organisational resilience. The extent to
   which accounting has been embraced appears mixed, however, with managers
   supportive of neo-liberal values and techniques, but frontline
   practitioners are more circumspect. Another unintended but emancipatory
   potential reflects the opportunities for social work professionals to
   reassert their epistemological claims by reshaping accounting with
   social work values. However, such outcomes remain a distant possibility,
   whilst managerialism retains its stranglehold on social work. This study
   raises awareness for the need not only to be cognizant of but also to
   critically evaluate accounting's role across all areas of social work.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the concept of legitimacy as applied to the use of
   power in statutory social work with children and families in the UK. It
   draws on literature from police studies and criminology, in which the
   concept is a stable one that continues to be heavily researched and
   analysed. Police and social workers bear comparison in respect of
   legitimacy because of the significant powers they use on behalf of the
   state with direct implications for the civil and human rights of their
   fellow citizens. The article defines legitimacy in theoretical terms
   before applying the concept to social work. Here, perceptions of
   fairness in the distribution of resources, the quality of treatment
   people receive, and the quality of decision-making are critically
   examined. The article then proposes a democratising agenda across the
   three domains of social work research, policy, and practice. Through
   challenging social work's legitimacy and analysing its relationship to
   social democracy, it is argued that new ways may be found to realign
   practice with the values of human rights and social justice that are
   said to underpin the profession. Given the severe socioeconomic impact
   of the Covid-19 pandemic on many families, these questions acquire a
   particular urgency.},

Abstract = {Qualitative research methods have traditionally been criticised for
   lacking rigor, and impressionistic and biased results. Subsequently, as
   qualitative methods have been increasingly used in social work inquiry,
   efforts to address these criticisms have also increased. Applied
   thematic analysis provides structure and integrates reflexivity in
   qualitative research using textual data. In this article, we describe
   how applied thematic analysis was operationalised in a document analysis
   of the official records of parliamentary debates in the Australian State
   of Victoria relating to the introduction of Permanent Care Orders, an
   alternative to adoption for children residing out-of-home and unable to
   be safely reunified with their parents. We present this example to
   extend the knowledge base regarding applied thematic analysis and to
   demonstrate how step-by-step implementation of a purposeful methodology
   using trustworthy documentary data can effectively increase rigor and
   transparency, thereby reducing potential bias, in a qualitative
   analysis. First, we clarify key terms; then discuss the challenges of
   analysing textual data; consider the value of parliamentary debates as a
   textual data source; and provide a detailed description of the processes
   undertaken in the document analysis. Finally, we reflect on the
   application of applied thematic analysis in our study, highlighting its
   value in strengthening qualitative social work research using document
   analysis.},

Title = {Social Impact Bonds and Homelessness: A Review of the Literature},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN SOCIAL WORK},
Abstract = {Funding for homelessness services in Australia has traditionally been
   based on short-term contracts centred on specific outputs, rather than
   outcomes. However, social work research has suggested that lengthier
   projects with individualised responses are needed, and longer-term
   funding is required to align with this need. Consequently, social impact
   bonds (SIBs), a new method of funding programs for longer time periods,
   have emerged, shifting the focus away from crisis management and towards
   prevention by assessing service usage and savings associated with a
   reduction in service usage. This approach relies heavily on funding from
   the private sector and is conditional on services meeting specific
   outcomes within a time frame. It is important for social workers to
   understand this new funding model and its implications for social
   policy, as well as to critically understand its alignments with social
   work values and purpose. This article has reviewed literature on the
   outcomes of homelessness interventions and how these outcomes may inform
   SIB investment in future. IMPLICATIONS SIB funding has the capacity to
   facilitate longer term programs. SIB funding has the potential to
   address the largely individualised presentation and support requirements
   for people experiencing homelessness. Social workers need to understand
   SIB structures and their potential to leverage sustainable longer-term
   funding, but also understand tensions such as how SIBs contribute to the
   movement of social welfare funding towards a more neoliberalist model.},

Abstract = {Dialogue between those interested or engaged in qualitative research and
   practitioners is essential if practice is to respond effectively to the
   increasing needs of service users. However, this statement is
   underpinned by two linked assumptions - that the world of the
   practitioner and that of the researcher are separate, and that there is
   a policy audience receptive to qualitatively informed professional
   practice. This paper begins by questioning these assumptions,
   recognising that neoliberal managerialism remains dominant and is
   resistant to qualitatively inspired practice, determined that
   practitioners are siloed' into skills or competence-based approaches in
   the name of accountability, value for money and outcomes' consistent
   with neoliberal ideology. We emphasise the shared values and commitments
   between social work practice and social work research which include the
   recognition that people may be encouraged to understand and transform
   their world through the constant interaction of theory and practice, a
   view we promote through our teaching. For example, social justice and
   other social work values are highlighted through participatory,
   anti-oppressive and feminist research and emphasised though critical,
   emancipatory approaches to research questions. We include recent
   vignettes, demonstrating this approach, in which students have used
   innovative research approaches, which have provided the possibility of
   fully integrating research into on-going practice. Feedback from
   students and practitioners concludes that this becomes possible if
   research teaching encourages partnership between students,
   practitioners, service users and organisations.},

Abstract = {Gentrification is changing the landscape of many cities worldwide,
   exacerbating economic and racial inequality. Despite its relevance to
   social work, the field has been conspicuously absent from scholarship
   related to gentrification. This paper introduces the dominant view of
   gentrification (a political economic lens), highlighting its
   contributions and vulnerabilities, then introduces four case studies
   that illuminate the distinct contributions of social work to broaden the
   ways in which gentrification is theorized and responded to within
   communities. Findings When gentrification is analyzed exclusively
   through a political economy lens, researchers, policy makers, and
   practitioners are likely to focus on changes in land and home values,
   reducing the adverse effects of gentrification to a loss of affordable
   housing. A singular focus on affordable housing risks paying
   insufficient attention to racial struggle, perpetuating damage-based
   views of poor people and neighborhoods, and obfuscating political,
   social, and cultural displacements. Social work practice-including
   social action group work, community organizing, community development,
   and participatory research and planning-offers a holistic approach to
   understanding, resisting, and responding to gentrification and advance
   equitable development in the city. Applications By exploring social work
   practice that amplifies residents' and change makers' efforts, advances
   existing community organizing, produces new insights, builds
   inter-neighborhood and interdisciplinary collaborations, and facilitates
   social action and policy change, this paper helps community
   practitioners to reimagine the role of social work research and practice
   in gentrifying neighborhoods.},

   received support across a diverse range of competing interest groups.
   Social work research in the area of disability can make a significant
   contribution to progressing a rights-based agenda in disability policy.
   This article provides a critical analysis of the NDIS using the ``What's
   the Problem Represented to be?{''} (WPR) framework developed by Carol
   Bacchi. The WPR analysis identifies ableist assumptions and principles
   informing the problematisation of disability in the NDIS, reinforcing
   the marginal status of specific groups of people with disability. The
   WPR approach can contribute to social work knowledge in the field of
   disability because it deconstructs policy discourses and social barriers
   facing people with disability and it provides for a more inclusive
   approach to acknowledging silences in policy and voicing differences.
   IMPLICATIONS The NDIS is promoted as the main plank of disability reform
   in Australia and considering core social work values about social
   justice and human rights, it is critical that social work critically
   engages with the NDIS. Ongoing social work engagement with disability
   reform and the NDIS will be essential in highlighting the silences in
   disability policy and working alongside people with disability as
   critical participants in advocating for the voices of marginalised
   groups of people with disability.},

Abstract = {This article reports on the evaluation of an initial pilot for a
   collaborative research project undertaken in an English county between a
   service user-led Coalition of Disabled People, the local authority and
   local university. The project sought to map the assets and resources
   for/of disabled people in their local community as well as needs and
   gaps, to inform the Coalition's strategic planning and raise awareness
   of disability issues across the county. The article discusses an
   inclusive, co-productive approach using participatory action research.
   It focuses on experiences from the pilot stage of the project and
   considers how the authors worked together with the required knowledge
   exchange and power-sharing to recruit and train researchers with
   expertise from their personal experience of disability. Recruitment
   ensured they had relevant qualities and skills that could be developed,
   to increase their confidence, knowledge and skills set as researchers.
   They then undertook photo-elicited, semi-structured interviews with
   other disabled people, analysed findings and created photographic
   exhibitions for dissemination and awareness raising. Demonstrating a
   commitment to emancipatory research and collective action for change,
   the discussion considers the promotion of shared values within the
   research team, and explores the benefits and challenges encountered
   during the process and how the particular stages were managed to achieve
   the beneficial outcomes of the pilot. The article seeks to add to the
   literature of participatory/emancipatory action research for social
   work.},

Abstract = {This article explores the relations between social work theory, research
   and practice in regard to poverty, arguing for the need to bring the
   political back into these three dimensions of the discipline/profession.
   Throughout the last decades, social work has been treating practice as a
   discrete technology, and left outside questions stemming from different
   theoretical approaches regarding the desired relationship between social
   workers and service users. This trend has divorced practice from its
   political dimensions. In this article I suggest to bring the political
   into social work, and specifically to exemplify the implications of
   using the context of power imbalance as an analytical framework for
   theory, research and practice with people in poverty. This move is
   illustrated through the example of a developing paradigm - Poverty Aware
   Social Work Paradigm'.},

Abstract = {After 14 years of debate, a new Global Definition of Social Work' has
   been ratified at the World Conference by the International Organisations
   IASSW/IFSW in Melbourne in 2004. Looking at it, it shows different
   problems: (1) the domain' of social work is very vaguely defined as life
   challenges'; (2) there is a moral-overload' of partially contradictory
   values underlying a profession as an example of moral-entrepreneurship',
   which is always on the right' and the good' side of history. (3) Human
   Rights and Social Justice are just value items on the same level as all
   other values and cannot offer anymore the possibility to articulate
   discrepancies between legality, indigenous knowledge and ethical
   legitimacy according to more general values and norms such as Human
   Dignity and Human Rights. The article offers explanations referring
   especially to a mainly Western/European tradition of epistemological
   constructivism and corresponding idealistic ontology, which dispossess
   the clients from their real distress and social workers from their
   disciplinary and professional domain and mandate.},

Abstract = {Social work has been under sustained scrutiny regarding the quality of
   decision-making. The assumption is that social workers make poor quality
   decisions. And yet our knowledge and understanding of how social workers
   make decisions is, at best, partial. In our view, examination of
   practitioner decision-making will be enhanced by considering the role
   that ethics plays in practical judgement in practice. Although there has
   been significant work regarding the role of values and ethics in
   practice, this work tends to idealize morality, setting up external
   standards by which practice is judged. In this paper, we will argue that
   ethics in practice needs to be understood as more than simply the
   operationalizing of ideal standards. Ethics also entails critical
   engagement with social issues and can challenge idealized statements of
   values. We outline the idea of the ethical dimension of practical
   reasoning, consider its relationship to professional discretion,
   judgements and decision-making and argue that this opens up an area of
   investigation that can illuminate the interaction between practice and
   ethical thinking and reflection in novel and - for social work, at least
   - unconventional ways.},

Abstract = {In the wake of a ``national care crisis{''} in England, an increasing
   number of parents return to the family court as repeat respondents in
   care proceedings and lose successive children from their care. Despite
   considerable progress in understanding the trends and patterns of
   mothers' (re)appearances in care proceedings, knowledge of fathers and
   of parents' family relationships in recurrent care proceedings remains
   very limited. Whilst such relationships are fundamentally at stake in
   care proceedings, they remain largely unexplored. Analyzing
   population-level administrative data from the family courts in England
   (2007/08-2017/18, N = 25,457 recurrent parents), we have, for the first
   time, uncovered a five-fold typology of family relations between
   mothers, fathers and children as they navigated repeated sets of care
   proceedings. We show that each identified profile is characterized by
   parents' gender as well as distinctive life-course positions of the
   parents and children. Our findings show that a substantial number of
   fathers are `visible' in care proceedings, and that the majority of
   those that return to court do so with the same partners and children, as
   part of either a recurrent family or recurrent couple. Mothers'
   recurrence is characterized by their re-partnering experiences and lone
   appearances before the court. The results underscore the value of
   applying a relational approach in social work research and practice, to
   build a fuller picture of recurrent care proceedings. This research
   provides new evidence to inform the development of holistic,
   gender-sensitive and father-inclusive services in the English family
   justice system.},

Abstract = {While oncology social workers are the primary providers of psychosocial
   services, they vary in what they do and how they work across different
   cancer care settings. Standards of Practice suggest that there exists a
   core or universal set of activities and tasks that are grounded in the
   values and principles of social work and apply across all settings. The
   purpose of this study was to identify activities that delineate and
   distinguish Competencies, Opportunities, Roles and Expertise (CORE) for
   oncology social work. Research was conducted using Concept Mapping, a
   structured and prescribed approach to collecting, analyzing, and
   interpreting qualitative and quantitative data while engaging
   stakeholders in the research process. Findings An expert panel of
   oncology social work practitioners, academicians, and leaders in the
   field (n = 35) generated 91 practice behaviors that were subject to card
   sorting and ratings of importance. A visual map consisting of six
   clusters best represented the statistical fit of the data (stress value
   = 0.18) while maintaining the most meaningful categorization of
   individual statements. These six domains were as follows: Clinical
   Assessment and Intervention (38 items; mean importance = 3.31);
   Professional Advocacy and Political Action (5 items; mean importance =
   3.03); Case Management and Care Coordination (16 items; mean importance
   = 3.02); Patient Education and Advocacy (8 items; mean importance =
   2.82); Organizational Support and Service (12 items; mean importance =
   2.74); Professional Education (12 items; mean importance = 2.45).
   Application These results may inform initiatives related to social work
   education and training, credentialing and certification, health policy,
   research and advocacy on behalf of patients, families, communities, and
   the profession.},

Title = {Breaking the rules: A group work perspective on focus group research},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {29},

Abstract = {Focus groups, originally used in fields such as marketing and consumer
   research, are rapidly gaining popularity as a research methodology in
   the social sciences. It is interesting to note that most of the
   scholarly work on focus groups continues to come from business rather
   than the social sciences. Few researchers have discussed the differing
   purposes and goals in social science and consumer research (Ospina,
   1994; Moore, 1996). Furthermore, the literature on focus group research
   rarely utilizes social work knowledge of group dynamics or group
   facilitation skills. Rather, the literature on focus groups tends to
   give guidelines for leading groups, telling focus group facilitators
   what to do and what not to do in leading such groups. We believe that
   these guidelines, while generally helpful, can lead to rigidity on the
   part of focus group leaders. We suggest that, in social work research,
   focus group facilitators should use their knowledge of soup dynamics and
   the values of individualization and empathy to modify focus group rules
   where appropriate.
   This paper describes part of a qualitative study of client/worker
   relationships in residential mental health settings. During the course
   of this research, group work principles came into conflict, at times,
   with recommended guidelines for focus group leaders. The paper
   illustrates how insights gleaned from group work theory and practice can
   enable a researcher to break focus group rules responsibly, thus
   bringing greater depth to the data gathered and allowing the researcher
   to be more sensitive to the needs of focus group participants.},

Abstract = {The research presented here aimed to give voice to Italian women who
   emigrated to Germany in the 1960s by giving an authentic account of
   their experiences and their coping abilities through participatory
   research approaches and the analysis of in-depth biographic interviews
   conducted 2012/2013 in the South of Germany. This type of interviewing
   itself often enabled the women, for the first time to reflect on their
   migration story, on their attachment to `Italy', on their relationship
   with the host country, its language and culture. They usually realised
   late in life that an originally provisional project had become
   permanent. Their thinking in `habitual patterns' is not to be taken as a
   sign of failed integration but reveals a differentiated strategy of
   managing the `in-between situation'. The higher quality of services in
   the host country is invariably a key factor in the decision to stay. The
   results indicate the benefits of recognising individual strengths in
   personal modes of adapting to multiple and often conflicting demands in
   the negotiation of multi-layered value structures. Differentiated
   listening skills to such voices and sensitive support strategies have
   far-reaching implications for both research and intervention methods in
   social work, and not just with migrants.},

Abstract = {Since 2010, Greece has experienced an unprecedented economic and
   humanitarian crisis, which continues to have tremendous social impact.
   Austerity measures and policy cuts have included a dis-investment in
   social work and social care and more recently the abolition of one of
   the four national Social Work Departments providing qualifying social
   work education. In this context, this study addresses the following
   question: how does pre-qualifying social work education in Greece
   influence students' ability to manage value tensions in relation to
   anti-oppressive practice? Using a case study methodology, the research
   was based in one Social Work Department (subsequently abolished). Data
   were collected through semi-structured interviews from social work
   students at the beginning and the end of their professional education (n
   = 32) and once from academic staff/placement supervisors (n = 10). Data
   were analysed drawing on grounded theory techniques. In this paper only
   one particular dataset is considered in detail: the attitudes and
   experiences of final year students. The main findings indicate students'
   narrow understandings and individualistic approaches towards oppression,
   reflecting an urgent need to redefine social work education and practice
   in Greece according to current social justice concerns. Specifically,
   social work education needs to give greater weight to a structural
   perspective on the dynamics of oppression. Although focussed on Greece,
   the paper offers a critical debate of contemporary relevance for social
   work education in many European nation states.},

Abstract = {Social work is unique among the social sciences in adopting the term
   practice wisdom. Why was the word wisdom chosen? Why didn't the terms
   practice knowledge or practical experience arise in its stead? This
   article examines various definitions of practice wisdom that have been
   previously offered. Then, turning to the work of Socrates, it examines
   the nature of wisdom. This leads to considering that the application of
   social work values, over that of efficacy of interventions, is what lies
   at the heart of practice wisdom.},

Title = {Balancing unity and diversity in a not-for-profit inter-organizational
   partnership through lateral accountability mechanisms},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper examines how lateral accountability mechanisms may be
   used to address the unity-diversity tension in a large not-for-profit
   (NFP) inter-organizational partnership governed under a lead
   organization model. Design/methodology/approach A case study was
   conducted in the New South Wales Settlement Partnership comprising 23
   NFP organizations providing settlement services for migrants and
   humanitarian entrants. Multiple data sources included semi-structured
   interviews, proprietary and publicly available documents and
   observation. Findings The paper demonstrates (1) the usefulness of a
   strength-based approach that the lead organization adopts in enacting
   lateral accountability mechanisms, which enables a balance between unity
   and diversity in the partnership; and (2) the capability of the lead
   organization governance model to address the unity-diversity tension.
   Research limitations/implications The paper (1) identifies the
   importance of a strength-based approach in implementing lateral
   accountability mechanisms to address the unity-diversity tension; and
   (2) challenges prior research that advocates the network administrative
   organization governance model in addressing the tension. Practical
   implications For practice, the paper identifies a suite of lateral
   accountability practices designed to address the unity-diversity
   tension. For policy, it provides confidence for government in
   promulgating the lead organization governance model in ``purchasing{''}
   public services. Originality/value The paper demonstrates how lateral
   accountability mechanisms may be used to provide a balance between the
   objectives of preserving and leveraging the benefits of partner
   diversity and achieving unity. The strength-based approach (used in
   enacting the accountability mechanisms), while having a history in
   psychology and social work research, has not been recognized in prior
   partnership accountability and governance studies.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to re-examine the social dimension of social support as
   the shared responsibility of social work and families in shaping social
   support rather than pressuring parents' individual responsibilities, as
   this has been a significantly under-theorised issue in social work
   research. In our qualitative study, we discuss parents' experiences of
   informal social support in Centres for Children and Parents (CCP) in two
   cities in Belgium. During 2012, six discussion groups were held with 29
   mothers, three fathers and one nanny who visited one of the CCP included
   in the project. A broad topic list was used, investigating parents'
   first visit and motivations to return; their encounters with other
   children, parents and the professionals; and the actual role of the
   professional. Data were interpreted repeatedly using qualitative content
   analysis. The CCP focus on engaging with a wide diversity of parents of
   young children, not framed as at risk', reflecting the contemporary
   contexts of diversity in which these practices unfold. Our research
   shows that departing from an anti-essentialist approach to diversity and
   heterogeneity may be productive for the promotion of both social support
   and social cohesion as it captures social issues such as diverse and
   changing norms and values, diverse and changing family compositions,
   lifestyles and situations, and diverse and changing biographical,
   socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds of children and parents. As the CCP
   offer the opportunity of a confrontation between private issues and
   public concerns, social encounters between a diverse mix of families are
   experienced as supportive. While embracing parents' perspectives
   regarding equity, reciprocity, agency and social cohesion, it becomes
   clear that these processes of interaction require facilitation by a
   specific professional. In this article, we attempt to unravel and
   discuss the possible role(s) of social work in generating informal
   social support.},

Abstract = {Limited attention has been given to the concept of place in social work
   research and practice. This paper draws on the national evaluation of
   social work practices (SWPs) in England undertaken between 2009 and
   2012. SWPs were pilot organisations providing independent social work
   services for children in out-of-home care in five sites. One factor
   distinguishing some of these pilots was their attention to place. The
   evaluation employed a mixed methods approach and we use data from
   interviews with 121 children and young people in out-of-home care, 19
   birth parents and 31 interviews with SWP staff which explored their
   views and experiences of the SWP offices. Children and young people were
   alert to the stigma which could attach to social work premises and
   appreciated offices which were planned and furnished to appear less
   institutional and more normal'. Daily interactions with staff which
   conveyed a sense of recognition and value to service users also
   contributed to a view of some SWP offices as accessible and welcoming
   places. Both children and parents appreciated offices that provided fun
   activities that positioned them as active rather than passive. Staff
   valued opportunities for influencing planning decisions about offices
   and place was seen to confer a value on them as well as on service
   users. However, not all the SWPs were able to achieve these aspects of
   place, and engaging children and families in place was less likely when
   the service user population was widely dispersed. Recognising the
   importance of place and how place is constructed through relationships
   between people as well as through the physical environment appeared to
   be key to creating offices that combated the stigma attached to
   out-of-home care. Those leading and managing children's services should
   explore ways of involving local communities in planning social work
   offices and turn attention to making these offices accessible,
   welcoming, places.},

Journal = {BMJ OPEN},

Volume = {10},
Number = {8},
Abstract = {Introduction Social work is a key profession in the field of mental
   health worldwide and the profession has values that are aligned with a
   recovery paradigm. However, there are gaps in understanding how social
   workers are applying the recovery paradigm in practice. This study will
   scope and synthesise the literature related to recovery and social work
   practice in mental health and addictions. There will also be an
   exploration of best practices and gaps in recovery-oriented social work
   practice. Methods and analysis Using a scoping review framework
   developed by Arksey and O'Malley, we will conduct our search in five
   academic databases: PsycINFO, Medline, CINAHL Plus, Sociological
   Abstracts and Social Services Abstracts. Articles meeting inclusion
   criteria will be charted to extract relevant themes and analysed using a
   qualitative thematic analysis approach. Ethics and dissemination This
   review will provide relevant information about best practices and gaps
   in recovery-oriented social work practice in mental health and
   addictions. The study will inform the development of mental health
   curricula in social work programmes and clinical settings. Results will
   be disseminated through a peer-reviewed journal and at conferences
   focusing on mental health, addictions, and social work education. Ethics
   approval is not required for this scoping review.},

Title = {Transition and transformation in youth care in the Netherlands: Emergent
   challenges for leadership and management in the youth sector},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC LEADERSHIP},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {96-108},
Abstract = {Purpose Since January 2015, the Dutch youth care system has been under
   construction. Its focus has shifted from the problematic to the normal
   development of children. Emphasis on the capacities of both youths and
   parents, on customized care and on better cooperation between
   professionals should decrease the use of specialized services. This
   reconstruction of the youth care system not only appeals to the
   competencies and skills of professionals, but also requires innovations
   in terms of leadership. The purpose of this paper is to describe the
   struggle managers face when working to transform the youth care system,
   and to provide some suggestions for how managers can be supported.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on the results of two
   empirical, qualitative studies that were recently conducted by the
   Research Institute Youth, which is part of the Health Care and Social
   Work Research Centre of Windesheim University of Applied Sciences in
   Zwolle, the Netherlands. Over the course of a preliminary study,
   executive managers of five youth care organizations were interviewed on
   the ongoing transformations of their organizations and the changing
   roles and needs of managers within these transformations. Subsequently,
   13 middle- and first-line managers of 3 youth care organizations were
   interviewed about their experiences and the ways in which they have
   handled the new roles they have taken on in transforming their
   organizations.
   Findings The management of youth care organizations is responsible for
   facilitating professionals in taking on and shaping their new roles,
   thus affecting not only the structure but also the culture and practices
   of youth care organizations and of management itself. This research
   shows that managers are struggling with these changes in their own ways.
   While youth care managers are struggling with their new roles and
   responsibilities, the intended transformation of the youth care system
   lags behind. Appropriate support of managers is essential, but is
   currently lacking. This paper provides some suggestions for how managers
   can be supported.
   Originality/value This paper identifies and explains the challenges that
   top-, middle- and lower-level managers face in current transformation
   processes in social service organizations, and provides some suggestions
   for how managers can be supported in these processes.},

Abstract = {Practice wisdom is reconceptualized as an integrating vehicle for
   combining the strengths and minimizing the limitations of both the
   `'objective,'' or empirical, practice model and the `'subjective,'' or
   intuitive-phenomenological, practice model in the development of
   efficacious knowledge in social work. Practice wisdom is defined as a
   personal and value-driven system of knowledge that emerges out of the
   transaction between the phenomenological experience of the client
   situation and the use of scientific information. The result of this
   transaction is tentative, often unarticulated knowledge that forms the
   basis for on-the-spot practice hypotheses that enable progress to be
   made on a case in the absence of fully tested methods. Feedback from
   these practice hypotheses both strengthens practice skills and
   contributes to the articulation of knowledge in standard forms such as
   evaluation and theory development.},

Abstract = {This national mixed method study with directors of 207 hospices
   identified major barriers to cultural competence, including (1) lack of
   funding for additional staff for community outreach or development of
   culturally competent programs, (2) lack of applications from diverse
   professionals, and (3) lack of knowledge about diverse cultures and what
   cultural groups in the community are not being served. Qualitative
   results indicated that elements of an organizational culture, which
   create barriers to access included (1) failure to prioritize cultural
   competence, (2) failure to budget for culturally competent services, and
   (3) a staff that does not value awareness of cultural differences, is
   uncomfortable with diversity, and stereotypes diverse individuals. In
   phase 2, an interactive session with a 100-symposium audience provided
   strategies to address the barriers.},

Abstract = {The recent social and economic transformation of inner cities in
   northern industrial regions is believed to foster conditions of
   disadvantage for low-income and minority residents. This article
   provides an analysis of neighborhood change in Cleveland in the 1980s
   using two-wave panel design and causal modeling and reveals several
   findings. The relationship of the poverty rate to housing values and the
   rate of births to unmarried mothers is reciprocal, implying a cycle of
   social and economic decline of a neighborhood. Although the percentage
   of nonwhite residents continues to predict the neighborhood poverty
   rate, the effect of minority populations on lowered housing values was
   stronger at the beginning of the decade than at the end, a sign of the
   declining significance of race on housing values. Drug-related crimes
   have a logged effect on neighborhood decline, and this effect overwhelms
   the cross-sectional effect of other types of crime rates, suggesting the
   pervasive influence of drug trafficking on neighborhood social and
   economic conditions.},

Abstract = {The author analyzed quantitative data from an NIMH-funded longitudinal
   study of 322 women with persistent severe mental illness (SMI) and
   qualitative data from sernistructured interviews with 82 of the women
   who ever lost custody of a child. The purpose was to test the
   hypothesis, derived from human ecology theory, that individual and
   environmental factors combine with mental illness to predict a history
   of child custody loss. The final model supported the increased
   likelihood of child custody loss for most women with persistent mental
   illness. Results provide support for directing policy advocacy and
   services toward ensuring a network of formal and informal support and
   resources and strengthening parenting skills and values for mothers with
   persistent SMI.},

Abstract = {Advocates of the scientist-practitioner model of social work argue that
   practitioners should use the model's twin pillars of single-system
   designs and standardized rapid assessment instruments to evaluate their
   practices. We evaluate the following central claims of the
   scientist-practitioner model: that it makes practice more effective,
   that it is needed to satisfy accountability requirements, that its
   advantages outweigh its disadvantages, that it provides valid causal
   knowledge of treatment effectiveness that be generalized to other cases,
   that it is not biased toward any particular practice theory, and that
   its lock of adoption by practitioners is not due to any deficiencies in
   the model itself. We find that the methods of the scientist-practitioner
   model are of unproved clinical effectiveness, limited scientific value,
   questionable practicality, and unknown net benefits.},

Abstract = {Recovery is an increasingly important construct in mental health
   services for adults with serious mental illnesses. It is defined as an
   active process of integrating mental health care with daily existence,
   creating a purposeful life regardless of diagnosis. Social work
   principles align with central values of recovery. Social workers who
   provide services to consumers may find it helpful to use a standardized
   recovery instrument in practice. The authors conducted a literature
   review to identify recovery instruments and assess the characteristics
   of those instruments, examining specifically the definitions of
   recovery, the nature of consumer involvement in instrument development,
   and the psychometric properties of recovery instruments. Multiple
   databases (CINHAL, JSTOR, PubMed, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, Social
   Sciences Citation Index, Social Services Abstracts, and Social Work
   Abstracts) were searched, as well as the gray literature. Seventeen
   articles discussing 12 recovery instruments were identified, with widely
   different conceptualizations of recovery, types of consumer involvement,
   and psychometric properties. Social workers should consider the purposes
   for which they wish to use a recovery instrument and, when appropriate,
   discuss recovery conceptualizations and goals with consumers. They
   should then select an instrument that best matches these goals. On the
   basis of this review, several instruments may be helpful to social
   workers in providing services to consumers.},

Abstract = {The study discussed in this article aimed to explore geographic
   variation in teen court program completion and recidivism and examine
   the value of teen courts from the point of view of respondents and their
   families. Mixed methods, including survival analysis and constant
   comparison analysis of qualitative interview findings, were used to
   address the study aims in a sample drawn from three jurisdictions.
   Results indicate that successful teen court participation was associated
   with low rates of recidivism, particularly when compared with youths who
   took part in teen court hearings but failed to comply with court
   requirements. Interview data identified themes reflecting fairness,
   consequences, and accountability. Findings suggest that teen courts play
   a valuable role in the spectrum of juvenile justice interventions.},

Abstract = {The great philosophy of science war has been waged for centuries
   regarding the `'correct'' way to understand human behavior, especially
   as a basis for helping people help themselves. For Francis Bacon, the
   correct way involved seeking empirical understanding as the basis for
   action. Far Auguste Comte, the correct way was largely empirical, but
   with the recognition of the place of the theoretical in science. For
   Rudolph Carnap, it was largely the logical-theoretical, bur with the
   recognition of the place of the empirical in science. The fourth
   positivism, here termed the `'value positivism'' of the human sciences,
   rejects the metaphysics of its age-which means wholesale rejection of
   logical positivism. And like every positivism before it, this latest
   entry into the greet philosophy of science war is filled with
   inconsistencies for which it, too, will be misunderstood, misquoted, and
   maligned, however much it also helps us to see human behavior more
   clearly and however much it leads to a more humane and effective helping
   profession.},

Abstract = {This study, a two-site, cross-sectional survey of university students (n
   = 321 at site 1; n = 201 at site 2), extends the development and utility
   of the Perceptions, Knowledge, and Attitudes about Human Trafficking
   Questionnaire by generating factor-based scales and scores to represent
   values for its three factors (Self-Appraisal of Knowledge/Skills,
   Worldview of Human Trafficking, and Help-Seeking Behavior/Personal
   Beliefs) in order to examine their relationship to background criterion
   variables and assess differences between social work and non-social work
   students and between subgroups of social work students. Across both
   samples, the background variables of human trafficking training and
   professional responsibilities related to addressing human trafficking
   were predictive of self-appraisal of knowledge/skills. Additionally,
   social work students had higher scores than non-social work students on
   the worldview of human trafficking and help-seeking behavior/personal
   beliefs factor-based scales, suggesting that social work students
   perceived human trafficking to be more of a social problem and held
   fewer misperceptions of the help-seeking behavior of and a greater
   willingness to provide social services to persons who are trafficked
   than non-social work students. Implications for social work education,
   practice, and research are presented.},

Abstract = {Young adult caregivers (YACs) of older adults are an often-overlooked
   subset of the caregiver population, though they make up more than a
   quarter of all caregivers. Because of their stage in life and their
   economic and work status, YACs (ages 21 to 40) are likely to face
   different caregiving challenges than other age cohorts of caregivers.
   Using the life course perspective and role conflict theory as
   foundational frameworks, this article compares the resources and strains
   of YACs with those of their middle-age caregiver (MAC) (ages 41 to 60)
   and older adult caregiver (OAC) (ages 61 and older) counterparts.
   Authors used data from a cross-sectional pilot study of caregivers
   recruited across one western state through community agencies. Through
   multivariate regression analysis, findings indicated that YACs reported
   more financial strain than MACs and OACs, despite being more likely to
   be employed. In contrast, YACs reported greater positive feelings toward
   caregiving than both MACs and OACs. These findings remained while
   controlling for employment status, education, and hours per week spent
   caregiving. Although YACs may find great value in caregiving, they may
   also be in more financially precarious situations. The article concludes
   with recommendations for caregiver support programs to reach YACs in the
   workplace.},

Abstract = {Despite elevated levels of substance use among many Latino youths, there
   has been little research on protective factors against such use. In
   keeping with federal commitments to address health disparities, this
   prospective study examined the protective influence of religion on
   substance use among a school-based sample (N = 804) of youths of Mexican
   heritage in the American Southwest. Drawing from the social capital
   literature, the authors posited that both integration into religious
   networks and trust in religious values at time 1 (T1) would predict less
   likelihood of using substances at time 2 (T2) but that exposure to
   religious norms at T1 would not predict subsequent substance use at T2.
   The hypotheses regarding religious networks and religious norms were
   largely confirmed, whereas little support emerged for the hypothesis
   regarding religious values. The results are discussed in light of the
   various pathways through which religion may exhibit a protective
   influence.},

Title = {Striving toward Community-Engaged and Participatory Methods:
   Considerations for Researchers in Academic Settings},
Journal = {SOCIAL WORK RESEARCH},
Abstract = {Community-engaged and participatory methods are increasingly used by
   academic researchers. Power dynamics in academia shape the landscape in
   which researchers implement these methods, yet are rarely understood and
   intentionally addressed. Through the lens of social work researchers at
   different career stages, this article describes how power relations
   within academia present challenges to community-engaged and
   participatory research across four stages of the research process
   (participant/researcher relationship, study formulation, conducting
   research, and publication/dissemination). These challenges are located
   within four domains of power identified by intersectionality scholars:
   Institutional policies such as those for tenure and promotion and for
   research administration presented challenges with the structural domain.
   Decisions about how to implement and enforce policies and operationalize
   what counts for tenure and promotion were identified as challenges
   within the disciplinary domain. Norms about who belongs on a university
   campus and what types of research are valued exemplified the cultural
   domain, while dynamics about who is viewed as an expert exemplified
   challenges the interpersonal domain. Across the research process, the
   article identifies potential solutions and suggests strategies for
   intentional consideration by academic researchers and their institutions
   to conduct meaningful, inclusive, and socially just research that shares
   power with community.},

Abstract = {A framework for the analysis of adolescent problem behaviors was
   explicated that draws on five major theories of human behavior. The
   framework emphasizes intentions to perform behaviors and factors that
   influence intentions as well as moderate the impact of intentions on
   behavior. The framework was applied to the analysis of adolescent sexual
   risk behavior in a population of 668 middle school youths in inner-city
   New York. Adolescents completed self-administered questionnaires in
   small group settings, assessing their past sexual activity, intentions
   to engage in sexual intercourse, expectancies about the advantages and
   disadvantages of engaging in sexual intercourse, normative pressures to
   engage in sex, the image implications of engaging in sex, emotional and
   affective reactions to engaging in sex, and self-efficacy with respect
   to engaging in sexual intercourse. The framework yielded high levels of
   predictability of intentions to have sex, with variables from each
   category proving to be of predictive value. The findings have important
   implications for social work researchers interested in the prevention of
   adolescent problem behavior.},

Title = {First-Time Violent Juvenile Offenders: Probation, Placement, and
   Recidivism},
Journal = {SOCIAL WORK RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {7-18},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Rising costs, inefficient systems, and high recidivism rates have
   recently challenged the social and economic value of secure confinement
   for juvenile offenders; however, current empirical evidence is
   inconclusive concerning the value of placing violent youth offenders in
   secure settings to deter them from future involvement in crime. Using
   propensity score matching and survival analysis, this study examined the
   risk of recidivism for first-time violent juvenile offenders assigned to
   one of three judicial dispositions in Los Angeles County: in-home
   probation, group-home placement, or probation camp (a secure setting).
   Approximately half (48\%) of first-time violent offenders experienced a
   subsequent arrest, and the risk of re-offending varied by disposition.
   Compared with in-home probation, the likelihood of recidivism was 2.12
   times greater for youths assigned to probation camps and 1.28 times
   greater for youths assigned to group homes. African American
   adolescents, Hispanic adolescents, and adolescents with an open child
   welfare case were also at an increased risk of recidivism. The findings
   from this study indicate that in-home probation is a more sensible and
   effective approach to interrupting criminal trajectories of first-time
   violent offenders as compared with out-of-home placements. Implications
   for research, system collaboration, and the training of social work
   professionals are discussed.},

Abstract = {Public debate about welfare reform has focused on reducing and
   eliminating cash assistance programs such as Aid to Families with
   Dependent Children (AFDC) and general assistance (GA). Widely held
   welfare stereotypes contribute to the unpopularity of welfare,
   especially programs serving groups viewed as undeserving. This article
   explores three bases for this negative stereotype-American values,
   conventional gender roles, and racial attitudes-and examines the
   relationship of the stereotype to actual recipient characteristics for a
   sample of former GA recipients in Michigan. The empirical investigation
   includes a descriptive profile of the Michigan GA population, an
   examination of the degree to which former GA recipients successfully
   found work after GA ended, and a discussion of the extent to which this
   employment varied by recipient characteristics. Overall, the findings
   run counter to the stereotypical assumptions. Recipients varied greatly
   by race, age, gender, and health status.},

Abstract = {Foster parents' ability to support a minority youth's cultural needs is
   critically important to the appropriate development of the youth's
   cultural identity and avoidance of negative reactions to real or
   perceived rejection or dismissal of their cultural values or traditions.
   This study assessed the ability of a set of practice-based measures to
   identify indicators of positive transcultural parenting. It involved a
   cross-sectional, nonprobability sample of 78 licensed foster parents who
   completed standardized foster parent assessments. Discriminant function
   analysis was used to correctly classify 91\% of respondents into two
   distinct groups of low- and high-scoring foster parents on a cluster of
   demographic and fostering predictors of openness to effectively
   parenting culturally different children. Foster parents' race, education
   level, dedication to fostering, available time to foster, understanding
   of certain foster parent roles, and knowledge of transcultural parenting
   activities were the strongest predictors of cultural receptivity, a
   precursor for competence in transcultural parenting. These findings
   demonstrate the potential usefulness of a set of psychometrically sound
   measures for prescreening and enhancing transcultural parenting skill
   sets among prospective foster parents who would likely support the
   psychological, social, and cultural development of youths of a different
   race, ethnicity, or culture from themselves.},

Abstract = {With more than 400,000 children in foster care in North America and the
   number expected to rise, it is important to know how these children are
   selected for removal from their parents and placed in foster care. This
   exploratory study examines the relative influence of categorical client
   variables on the dichotomous child placement variable using an odds
   ratio approach. Although the odds ratio appears only rarely in child
   welfare research studies, it is widely used in chemical, genetic,
   behavioral science, and medical contexts. The odds ratio has several
   desirable properties in the analysis of the decision-making process: the
   odds ratio provides a clear interpretative value that does not require
   transformation and is ideally suited for analyzing multidimensional
   tables. The findings from the odds ratio analysis are interpreted
   against the background of previous studies of the foster care placement
   decision-making process.},

Abstract = {This study examines the social and contextual factors that influence the
   role perceptions of black fathers. Age, education, employment, and
   income were the identified independent variables. A cross-sectional
   survey research design was used. A multistage cluster sampling technique
   was implemented to select 50 black fathers to complete a
   self-administered questionnaire. The respondent fathers were selected
   from two professional organizations and two homeless shelters in
   metropolitan Atlanta. Pearson correlation and chi-square test statistics
   were computed to determine if significant relationships existed between
   each independent variable and the role perceptions of black fathers.
   Results indicated no significant relationship between age or education
   and the role perceptions of black fathers. The number of hours per week
   of work and the income of the black father were found to be
   significantly related at the .05 level to the saliency of role
   perceptions for respondent fathers. Implications for social work
   knowledge, theory, and practice are discussed using humanistic values,
   the Afrocentric perspective, the autonomous social work practice model,
   and planned change.},

Abstract = {This study investigated one potential mechanism mediating continuity and
   discontinuity in low-income status across generations: children's
   educational aspirations and expectations. Data were drawn from a
   community sample of 808 participants who were followed from age 10 to
   30. Four trajectory groups of children's educational aspirations and
   expectations were identified from ages 10 to 18 (grades five through
   12): ``stable-high{''} group, ``stable-low{''} group, ``increaser{''}
   group, and ``decreaser{''} group. Among participants from low-income
   families, those in the stable-high group and the increaser group were
   equally likely to graduate from high school. High school graduation was
   positively associated with level of total household income at age 30.
   Findings suggest that social work efforts that support the development
   of high educational aspirations and expectations in children might serve
   to reduce the intergenerational continuity of low-income status.},
